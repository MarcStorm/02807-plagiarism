|f INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,

ABRIDGED.



The " Call to the Unconverted " by Richard Bax •
ter, is characterized by all that solemn earnestness,
and urgency of appeal, for winch the writings of this
much-admired author are so peculiarly distinguished.
He seems to look upon mankind solely with the eyes
of the Spirit, and exclusively to recognize them in
their spiritual relations, and in the great and essential
elements of their immortal being. Their future des-
tiny is the all-important concern which fills and en-
grosses his mind, and he regards nothing of any mag-
nitude but what has a distinct bearing on their spiri-
tual and eternal condition. His business, therefore, is
always with the conscience, to which he makes the
most forcible appeals, ami which he plies with all
those arguments which are fitted to awaken the sinner
to a deep sense of the necessity and importance of im-
mediate repentance. He endeavors to move him by
the most touching of all representations, the tender-
ness of a beseeching God waiting to be gracious, and
not willing that any should perish ; and while he em-
ploys every form of entreaty, which tenderness and
compassion can suggest, to allure the sinner to "turn
and live," he does not shrink from forcing on his con-
victions those considerations which are fitted to alarm
his fears, the terrors of the Lord, and the wrath, not
merely of an offended Lawgiver, but of a God of love,
whose threatemngs he disregards, whose grace he des*



4 INTRODUCTION.

pises, and whose mercy he rejects. And aware of the
deceitfulness of sin in hardening the heart, and in be-
traying the sinner into a neglect of his spiritual inte-
rests, he divests him of every refuge, and strips him of
every plea for postponing his preparation for eternity.
He forcibly exposes the delusion of convenient seasons,
and the awful infatuation and hazard of delay, and
Knowing the magnitude of the stake at issue, he urges
the sinner to immediate repentance, as if the fearful
and almost absolute alternative were "Now or Never."
And to secure the commencement of such an important
work against all the dangers to which procrastination
might expose it, he endeavors to arrest the sinner in
his career of guilt and unconcern, and resolutely to fix
his determination on " turning to God this day with-
out delay."

There are two very prevalent delusions on this sub-
ject, which we should like to expose ; the one regards
the nature, and the other the season of repentance;
both of which are pregnant with mischief to the minds
of men. With regard to the first, much mischief has
arisen from mistakes respecting the meaning of tho
tenn repentance. The word repentance occurs with
two different meanings in the New Testament ; and
it is to be regretted, that two different words could not
have been devised to express these. This is charge-
able upon the poverty of our language; for it is to be
observed, that in the original Greek the distinction in
the meanings is pointed out by a distinction in tho
words. The employment of one term to denote two
different things has the effect of confounding and mis-
leading the understanding ; and it is much to be
wished, that every ambiguity of this kind were clear-
ed away from that most interesting point in the pro-



INTRODUCTION. 5

cess of a human soul, ax which it turns from sin unto
righteousness, and from the power of Satan unto God.

When in common language, a man says, " I repent
of such an action," he is understood to say, " I am sorry
for having done it." The feeling is familiar to all of
us. How often does the man of dissipation prove this
sense of the word repentance, when he awakes in the
monung, and, oppressed by the languor of ins ex-
hausted faculties, looks back with remorse on the fol-
lies and profligacies of the night that is past? How
often does the man of unguarded conversation prove it,
when he thinks of the friends whose feelings he has
wounded by some hasty utterance which he cannot
recall 1 How often is it proved by the man of business,
when he reflects on the rash engagement which ties
him down to a losing speculation? All these people
would be perfectly understood wiien they say, " We
repent of these doings." The word repentance so
applied is about equivalent to the word regret. There
are several passages in the New Testament where
this is the undoubted sense of the word repentance.
In Matt. 27: 3. the wretched Judas repented himself
of his treachery ; and surely, wlien we think of the
awful denunciation uttered by our Savior against the
man who should betray him, that it were better for
him if he had not been born, we shall never confound
the repentance which Judas experienced with that
repentance winch is unto salvation.

Now here lies the danger to practical Christianity.
In the above-cited passage, to repent is just to regret,
or to be sorry for ; and tins we conceive .o be by fai
the most prevailing sense of the term in the English
language. But there are other places where the same
term is employed to denote that which is urged upon



6 INTRODUCTION.

us as a duty — that which is preached for the remis-
sion of sins — that which is so indispensable to sinners,
as to call forth the declaration from our Savior, thai
unless we have it, we shall all likewise perish. Now,
though repentance, in all these cases, is expressed by
the same term in our translation as the repentance ot
mere regret, it is expressed by a different term in the
original record of our faith. This surely might lead
us to suspect a difference of meaning, and should cau-
tion us against taking up with that, as sufficient for
the business of our salvation, which is short of saving
and scriptural repentance. There may be an alterna-
tion of wilful sin, and of deep-felt sorrow, up to th©
very end of our history — there may be a presumptu-
ous sin committed every day, and a sorrow regularly
succeeding it. Sorrow may imbitter every act of sin —
sorrow may darken every interval of sinful indul-
gence — and sorrow may give an unutterable anguish
to the pains and the prospects of a deathbed. Couple
all this with the circumstance that sorrow passes, in
the common currency of our language, for repentance ,
and that repentance is made, by our Bible, to lie at
the turning point from a state of condemnation to a
state of acceptance with God; and it is difficult not to
conceive thai much danger may have arisen from this,
leading to indistinct views of the nature of repentance,
and to slender and superficial conceptions of the migh-
ty change which is implied in it.

We are far from saying that the eye of Christiana
is not open to this danger — and that the vigilant care
of Christian authors has not been employed in avert-
ing it. Where will we get a better definition of re-
pentance unto life than in our Shorter Catechism? by
which the sinner is represented not merely as grieving.



INTRODUCTION. 7

but, along with his grief and hatred of sin, aa turning
from it unto God with full purpose of, and endeavor
after new obedience. But the mischief is, that the
word repent has a common meaning, different from
the theological ; that wherever it is used, this common
meaning is apt to intrude itself, and exert a kind of
habitual imposition upon the understanding — that the
influence of the single word carries it over the influ-
ence of the lengthened explanation — and thus it is
that, for a steady progress in the obedience of the
gospel, many persevere, to the end of their days, in a
wretched course of sinning and cf sorrowing, without
fruit and without amendment.

To save the practically mischievous effect arising
from the application of one term to two different things,
one distinct and appropriate tenn has been suggested
for the saving repentance of the New Testament.
The term repentance itself has been restricted to the
repentance of mere sorrow, and is made equivalent to
regret ; and for the other, able translators have
adopted the word reformation. The one is expressive
of sorrow for our past conduct ; the other is expressive
of our renouncing it. It denotes an actual turning
from the habits of life that we are sorry for. Give us,
say they, a change from bad deeds to good deeds,
from bad habits to good habits, from a life of wicked-
ness to a life of conformity to the requirements of
heaven, and you give us reformation.

Now there is often nothing more unprofitable than
a dispute about words ; but if a word has got into com-
mon use, a common and generally understood mean-
ing is attached to it ; and if this meaning does not
just come up to the thing which we want to express
by it, the application of that word to that thing has



3 INTRODUCTION-

the same misleading effects as in the case already
alluded to. Now, we have much the same kind of
exception to allege against the term reformation, that
we have alleged against the term repentance. The
term repentance is inadequate — and why? because,
in the common use of it, it is equivalent to regret, and
regret is short of the saving change that is spoken of
in the New Testament. On the very same principle,
we count the term reformation to be inadequate. We
think that, in common language, a man would receive
the appellation of a reformed man upon the mere
change of his outward habits, without any reference
to the change of mind and of principle which gave
rise to it. Let the drunkard give up his excesses —
let the backbiter give up his evil speakings — let the
extortioner give up his unfair charges — and we would
apply to one and all of them, upon the mere change
of their external doings, the character of reformed
men. Now, it is evident that the drunkard may give
up his drunkenness, because checked by a serious im-
pression of the injury he has been doing to his health
and his circumstances. The backbiter may give up
his evil speaking, on being made to perceive that the
hateful practice has brought upon him the contempt
and alienation of his neighbors. The extortioner may
give up his unfair charges, upon taking it into calcu-
lation that his business is likely to suffer by the deser-
tion of his customers. Now, it is evident, that though
in each of these cases there has been what the world
would call reformation, there has not been scriptural
repentance. The deficiency of the former term con-
gists in its having been employed to denote a mere
change in the deeds or in the habits of the outward
man • and if employed as equivalent to repentance, it



INTRODUCTION. y

may delude us into the idea that the change by which
we are made meet for a happy eternity is a far more
slender and superficial thing than it really is. It is
of little importance to be told that the translator means
it only in the sense of a reformed conduct, proceeding
from the influence of a new and a right principle
within. The common meaning of the word will, as
in the former instance, be ever and anon intruding
itself, and get the better of all the formal cautions, and
all the qualifying clauses of our Bible commentators.
But, will not the original word itself throw some
light upon this important question? The repentance
which is enjoined as a duty — the repentance which
is unto salvation — the repentance which sinners un-
dergo when they pass to a state of acceptance with
God from a state of enmity against him — these are
all one and the same thing, and are expressed by one
and the same word in the original language of the
New Testament. It is different from the word which
expresses the repentance of sorrow ; and if translated
according to the parts of which it is composed, it sig-
nifies neither more nor less than a change of mind.
This of itself is sufficient to prove the inadequacy ot
the term reformation^a term which is often applied
to a man upon the mere change of his conduct, with-
out ever adverting to the state of his mind, or to the
kind of change in motive and in principle which it
has undergone. It is true, that there can be no change
in the conduct without some change in the inward
principle. A reformed drunkard, before careless about
health or fortune, may be so far changed as to become
impressed with these considerations; but this change
is evidently short of that which the Bible calls repent-
ance toward God. It is a change that may, and has



10 INTRpDUCTION.

taken place in many a mind, when there was no
effectual sense of the God who is above us, and of the
eternity which is before us. It is a change, brought
about by the prospect and the calculation of worldly
advantages ; and, in the enjoyment of these advan-
tages it hath its sole reward. But it is not done unto
God, and God will not accept of it as done unto him.
Reformation may signify nothing more than the mere
surface-dressing of those decencies, and proprieties,
and accomplishments, and civil and prudential duties,
which, however fitted to secure a man's acceptance
in society, may, one and all of them, consist with a
heart alienated from God, and having every principle
and affection of the inner man away from him. True,
it is such a change as the man will reap benefit from,
as his friends will rejoice in, as the world will call
reformation ; but it is not such a change as will make
him meet for heaven; nor is it, in its import, what our
Savior speaks of, when he says, " I tell you nay, ex-
cept ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."

There is no single word in the English language
which occurs to us as fully equal to the faithful ren-
dering of the term in the original. Renewedness oj
mind, however awkward a phrase this may be, is
perhaps the most nearly expressive of it. Certain it
is, that it harmonizes with those other passages of the
Bible where the process is described by which saving
repentance ie brought about. We read of being
transformed by the renewing of our minds, of the re-
newing of the Holy Ghost, of being renewed in the
spirit of our minds. Scriptural repentance, therefore,
is that deep and radical change whereby a said turns
from the idcls of sin and of self unto God, and de-
votes eve?y movement of the inner and Vie outer man

to ihe. captivity of his obedicwe. This is the change
which, whether it be expressed by one word or not in
the English language, we would have you well to
understand ; and reformation or change in the out-
ward conduct, instead of being saving and scriptural
repentance, is what, in the language of John the
Baptist, we would call a fruit meet for it. But if
miscliief is likely to arise, from the want of an ade-
quate word in our language, to that repentance which
is unto salvation, there is one effectual preservative
against it — a firm and consistent exhibition of the
whole counsel and revelation of God. A man who is
well read in his New Testament, and reads it with
docility, will dismiss all his meagre conceptions of
repentance when he comes to the following state-
ments: — "Except a man be born again he cannot
see the kingdom of God." " Except ye be converted,
and become as little children, ye shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven." " If any man have not the
Spirit of Christ he is none of his." " The carnal
mind is enmity against God ; and if ye live after the
flesh ye shall die; but if ye, through the Spirit, do
mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live." " Be not
then conformed to this world, but be ye transformed
by the renewing of your minds." Such are the terms
employed to describe the process by which the soul
of man is renewed unto repentance ; and, with your
hearts familiarized to the mighty import of these
terms, you will carry with you an effectual guarantee
against those false and flimsy impressions, which are
so current in the world, about the preparation of a
sinner for eternity. *****

We should like, moreover, to reduce every man to
the feeling of repentance now or the alternative of



12 INTRODUCTION.

repentance never. We should like to flash it upmi
your convictions, that, by putting the call away from
you now, you put your eternity away from you. We
should like tc expose the whole amount of that accure
ed infatuation which lies in delay. We should like to
arouse every soul out of its lethargies, and give noquar*
ter to the plea of a little more sleep, and a little more
slumber. We should like you to feel as if the whole of
your future destiny hinged on the very first movement
to which you turned yourselves. The work of repent-
ance must have a beginning; and we should like you
to know that, if not begun to-day, the chance will be
less of its being begun to-morrow. And if the greater
chance has failed, what hope can we build upon the
smaller?— and a chance to that is always getting
smaller. Each day, as it revolves over the sinner's
head, finds him a harder, and a more obstinate, ana
a more helplessly enslaved sinner, than belbre. It
was this consideration which gave Richard Baxter
such earnestness and such urgency in his " Call." He
knew that the barrier in the way of the sinner's return
was strengthened by every act of resistance to the call
which urges it. That the refusal of this moment
hardened the man against the next attack of a Gos-
pel argument that is brought to bear upon him. That
-.f he attempted you now, and he failed, when he came
back upon yoa he would find himself working on a
more obstinate and uncomplying subject than ever.
And therefore it is that he ever feels as if the present
were his only opportunity. That he is now upon his
vantage ground, and he gives every energy of his
soul to the great point of making the most of it. He
will put up with none of your evasions. He will
consent to none of your postponements. He will pay



INTRODUCTION. 13

respect to none of your more convenient seasons. He
tells you, that the matter with which he is charged
lias all the urgency of a matter in hand. He speaka
to you with as much earnestness as if he knew that
you were going to step into eternity in half an hour.
He delivers his message with as much solemnity as if
he knew that tins was your last meeting on earth,
and that you were never to see each other till you
stood together at the judgment-seat. He knew that
some mighty change must take place in you ere you
be fit for entering into the presence of God ; and that
the time in which, on every plea of duty and of inte
rest, you should bestir yourselves to secure this, is the
present time. This is the distinct point he assigns to
himself; and the whole drift of his argument is to
urge an instantaneous choice of the better part, by
telling you how you multiply every day the obstacles
to your future repentance, if you begin not the work
of repentance now.

Before bringing our Essay to a close we shall make
some observations on the mistakes concerning repent-
ance, which we have endeavored to expose, and ad-
duce some arguments for urging on the consciences of
our -readers tke necessity and importance of imme-
diate repentance.

1. The work of repentance is a work which must
be done ere we die ; for, unless we repent, we shall all
likewise perish. Now, the easier this work is in our
conception, we shall think it the less necessary to enter
upon it immediately. We shall leok upon it as a
work that may be done at any time, and therefore put
it off a little longer, and a little longer. We shall,
perhaps, look forward to that retirement from the
world and its temptations which we figure old age to

bring along with it, and falling in with the too com
mon idea, that, the evening of life is the appropriate
season of preparation for another world, we shall
think that the author is bearing too closely and too
urgently upon us, when, in the language of the Bible,
he speaks of " to-day," while it is called to-day, and
will let us off with no other repentance than repent-
ance "now," seeing that now only is the accepted
time, and now only the day of salvation, which he
has a warrant to proclaim to us. This dilatory way
of it is very much favored by the mistaken and very
defective view of repentance which we have attempt-
ed to expose. We have some how or other got into
the delusion that repentance is nothing but sorrow;
and were we called to fix upon the scene where this
sorrow is likely to be felt in the degree that it is deep-
est and most overwhelming, we would point to the
chamber of the dying man. It is awful to think that,
generally speaking, this repentance of mere sorrow is
the only repentance of a death-bed. Yes ! we shall
meet with sensibility deep enough and painful enough
there — with regret in all its bitterness — with terror
mustering up its images of despair, and dwelling
upon them in all the gloom of an affrighted imagina-
tion ; and this is mistaken, not merely for the drapery
of repentance, but for the very substance of it. We
look forward, and we count upon this — that the sins
of a life are to be expunged by the sighing and sor
rowing of the last days of it. We should give up this
wretchedly superficial notion of repentance, a nd cease,
from this moment, to be led astray by it. The mind
may sorrow over its corruptions at the very time that
it is under the poAver of them. A man may weep
mast bitterly over the perversities of his moral consli-



INTRODUCTION. 15

uition; but to change that constitution, under the
workings of the Holy Spirit, is a different affair.
"Now, this is the mighty work of repentance. He who
has undergone it is no longer the servant of sin. He
dies unto sin, he lives unto God. A sense of the au-
thority of God is ever present with him, to wield the
ascendancy of a great master-principle over all his
movements — to call forth every purpose, and to carry
it forward, through all the opposition of sin and of
Satan, into accomplishment. This is the grand revo-
lution in the s£ate of the mind which repentance
brings along with it. To grieve because this work is
not done, is a very different thing from the doing of it.
A deathbed is the very best scene for acting the first ,
but it is the very worst for acting the second. The re-
pentance of Judas has often been acted there. We
ought to think of the work in all its magnitude, and
not to put it off' to that awful period when the soul is
crowded with other things, and has to maintain its
weary struggle with the pains, and the distresses,
and the shiverings, and the breathless agonies cf a
deathbed.

2. There are two views that may be taken of the
way in which repentance is brought about, and which-
ever of them is adopted, delay carries along with it
the saddest infatuation. It may be looked upon as
a step taken by man as a voluntary agent, and we
would ask you, upon your experience of the powers
and the performances of humanity, if a deathbed is
the time for taking such a step? Is this a time for a
voluntary being exercising a vigorous control over his
own movements? When racked with pain, and borne
down by the pressure cf a sore and overwhelming
calamity ? Surely the greater the work of repentance



16 INTRODUCTION.

is, the more ease, the more time, the more freedom
from suffering, is necessary for carrying itonj and,
therefore, addressing you as voluntary beings, as
beings who will and who do, we call upon you to seek
God early that you may find him— to haste, and make
no delay in keeping his commandments.

The other view is, that repentance is not a self-
originating work in man, but the work of the Holy
Spirit in him as the subject of its influences. This
view is not opposite to the former. It is true that man
wills and does at every step in the business of his sal-
vation; and it is as true that God works in him so to
will and to do. Take this last view of it then. Look
on repentance as the work of God's Spirit in the soul
of man, and we are furnished with a more impressive
argument than ever, and set on higher vantage for
urging you to stir yourselves, and set about it im-
mediately. What is it that you propose ? To keep
by your present habits, and your present indulgences,
and build yourselves up all the while in the confidence
that the Spirit will interpose with his mighty power
of conversion upon you, at the very point of time that
you have fixed upon as convenient and agreeable?
And how do you conciliate the Spirit's answer to your
call then? Why, by doing all you can to grieve, and
to quench, and to provoke him to abandon you now.
Do you feel a motion toward repentance at this mo-
ment? If you keep it alive, and act upon it, good and
well. But if you smother and suppress this motion,
you resist the Spirit — you stifle his movements within
you ; it is what the impenitent do day after day, and
year after year — and is this the way for securing the
influences of the Spirit at the time that you would
like them best? When you are done with the world,



TNTR0DUCT10N. 17

and are looking forward to eternity because you can-
not help it? God says, "My Spirit shall not always
strive with man." A good and a free Spirit he un-
doubtedly is, and, as a proof of it, he is now saying,
"Let whosoever will, come and take of the water of
life freely." He says so now, but we do not promise
that he will say so with effect upon your deathbeds,
if you refuse him now. You look forward then for a
powerful work of conversion being done upon you, and
yet you employ yourselves all your life long in raising
and multiplying obstacles against it You count upon
a miracle of grace before you die, and the way you
take to make yourselves sure of it, is to grieve and
offend him while you live, who alone can perform the
miracle. O what cruel deceits will sin land us in !
and how artfully it pleads for a " little more sleep, and
a little more slumber; a little more folding of the
hands to sleep." We should hold out no longer, nor
make such an abuse of the forbearance of God : we
shall treasure up wrath against the day of wrath if
we do so. The genuine effect of his geodness is to
lead us to repentance ; let not its effect upon us be to
harden and encourage ourselves in the ways of sin.
We should cry now for the clean heart and the right
spirit; and such is the exceeding freeness of the Spirit
of Gcd, that we shall be listened to. If we put off the
cry till then, the same God may laugh at our calam-
ity, and mock when our fear cometh.

3. Our next argument for immediate repentance is,
that we cannot bring forward, at any future period o!
your history, any considerations of a more prevailing
or more powerfully moving influence than those we
may bring forward at this moment. We can tell you
now of the terrors cif the Lord, we can tell you now
2*



18 INTRODUCTION.

of the solemn mandates which have issued from his
throne — and the authority of which is upon one and
all of you. We can tell you now, that, though, in
this dead and darkened world, sin appears but a
very, trivia' affair — for every body sins, and it is
shielded from execration by the universal countenance
of an entire species lying in wickedness — yet it holds
true of God, what is so emphatically said of him, that
he cannot be mocked, nor will he endure it that you
should not in the impunity of your wilful resistance
to him and to his warnings. We can tell you now,
that he is a God of vengeance ; and though, for a
season, he is keeping back all the thunder of it from a
world that he would reclaim unto himself, yet, if you
put all his expostulations away from you, and will not
be reclaimed, these thunders will be let loose upon
you, and they will fall on your guilty heads, armed
with tenfold energy, because you have not only defied
his threats, but turned your back on his offers of re-
conciliation. These are the arguments by which we
would try to open our way to your consciences, and to
awaken up your fears, and to put the inspiring activity
of hope into your bosoms, by laying before you those
invitations which are addressed to the sinner, through
the peace-speaking blood of Jesus, and, in the name
of a beseeching God, to win your acceptance of them.
At no future period can we address arguments more
powerful and more affecting than these. If these ar-
guments do not prevail upon you, we know of none
others by which a victory over the stubborn and un-
complying will can be accomplished, or by which we
can ever hope to beat in that sullen front of resistance
wherewith you now so impregnably withstand us.
We feel thnt, if any stout-hearted sinner shall rise



INTRODUCTION. 19

from the perusal of this "Call to the Unconverted"
with an unawakened conscience, and give himself up
to wilful disobedience — we feel as if, in reference to
him, we had made our last discharge, and it fell
powerless as water spilt on the ground, that cannot be
gathered up again. Therefore it is that we speak to
you now as if this was our last hold of you. We feel
as if on your present purpose hung all the prepara-
tions of your future life, and all the rewards or all the
horrors of your coming eternity. We will not let you
off with any other repentance than repentance now ;
and if this be refused now, we cannot, with our eyes
open to the consideration we have now urged, that
the instrument we can make to bear upon you here-
after is not more powerful than we are wielding now,
coupled with another consideration w r hich we shall
insist upon, that the subject on which the instrument
worketh, even the heart of man, gathers, by every
act of resistance, a more uncomplying obstinacy than
before ; we cannot, with these two thoughts in our
mind, look forward to your future history, without
seeing spread over the whole path of it the iron of a
harder impenitency — the sullen gloom of a deeper
and more determined alienation.

4. Another argument, therefore, for immediate re-
pentance is, that the mind which resists a present call
or a present reproof, undergoes a progressive harden-
ing' toward all those considerations which arm the
call of repentance with all its energy. It is not enough
to say, that the instrument by which repentance is
brought about, is not more powerful to-morrow than
it is to-day ; it lends a most tremendous weight to the
argument, to say further, that the subject on which
this instrument is putting forth its efficiency, will op-



20 INTRODUCTION.

pose a firmer resistence to-morrow than it does to-day.
It is this which gives a significancy so powerful to the
call of "To-day while it is to-day, harden not your
hearts ;" and to the admonition of " Knowest thou not,
O man, that the goodness of God leadeth thee to re-
pentance; but after, thy hardness and impenitent
heart treasurest up wrath against the day of wrath
und revelation of the righteous judgments of God?"
It is not said, either in the one or in the other of these
passages, that, by the present refusal, you cut your-
self off from a future invitation. The invitation may
be sounded in your hearing to the last half hour of
your earthly existence, engraved in all those charac-
ters of free and gratuitous kindness which mark the
beneficent religion of the New Testament. But the
present refusal hardens you against the power and
tenderness of the future invitation. This is the fact
in human nature to which these passages seem to
point, and it is the fact through which the argument
for immediate repentance receives such powerful aid
from the wisdom of experience. It is this which forms
the most impressive proof of the necessity of plying
the young with all the weight and all the tenderness
of earnest admonition, that the now susceptible mind
might not turn into a substance harder and more un-
complying than the rock which is broken in pieces
by the powerful application of the hammer of the
word of God.

The metal of the human soul, so to speak, is like
some material substances. If the force you lay upon
it do not break it, or dissolve it, it will beat it into
hardness. If the moral argument by which it is plied
now, do not so soften the mind as to carry and to over-
power its purposes, then, on another day, the argu-

ment may be put forth in terms as impressive — but it
falls on a harder mind, and, therefore, with a more
slender efficiency. If the threat, that ye who persist
in 6in shall have to dwell with the devouring fire, and
to lie down amid everlasting burnings, do not alarm
you out of your iniquities from this very moment, then
the same tlireat may be again cast out, and the same
appalling circumstances of terror be thrown around it,
but it is all discharged on a soul hardened by its inure-
ment to the thunder of denunciations already uttered,
and the urgency of menacing threatenings already
poured forth without fruit and without efficacy. If
the voice of a beseeching God do not win upon you
now, and charm you out of your rebellion against him,
by the persuasive energy of kindness, then let that
voice be lifted in your hearing on some future day,
and though armed with all the power of tenderness
it ever had, how shall it find its entrance into a heart
sheathed by the operation of habit, that universal law.
in more impenetrable obstinacy 1 If, with the earliest
dawn of your understanding, you have been offered
the hire of the morning laborer and have refused it,
then the parable does not say that you are the person
who at the third, or sixth, or ninth, or eleventh hour,
will get the offer repeated to you. It is true, that the
offer is unto all and upon all who are within reach of
the hearing of it. But there is all the difference in
the world between the impression of a new offer, and
of an offer that has already been often heard and as
often rejected — an offer which comes upon you with
all the familiarity of a well-known sound that you
have already learned how to dispose of, and how to
shut your every feeling against the power of its gra-
cious invitations — an offer which, if discarded from
your hearts at the present moment, may come back

upon you, but which will have to maintain a more
unequal contest than before, with an impcnitency ever
strengthening, and ever gathering new hardness from
each successive act of resistance. And thus it is that
the point for which we are contending is not to cany
you at some future period of your lives, but to carry
you at this moment. It is to work in you the instan-
taneous purpose of a firm and a vigorously sustained
repentance ; it is to put into you all the freshness oi
an immediate resolution, and to stir you up to all the
readiness of an immediate accomplishment — it is to
give direction to the very first footstep you are now
to take, and lead you to take it as the commencement
of that holy career in which all old things are done
away, and all things become new — it is to press it
upon you, that the state of the alternative, at this mo-
ment, is "now or never" — it is to prove how fearful
die odds are against you, if now you suffer the call of
repentance to light upon your consciences, and still
keep by your determined posture of careless, and
thoughtless, and thankless unconcern about God. You
have resisted to-day, and by that resistance you have
acquired a firmer metal of resistance against the
power of every future warning that may be brought
to bear upon you. You have stood your ground
against the urgency of the most earnest admonitions,
and against the dreadfulness of the most terrifying
menaces. On that ground ycu have fixed yourself
more immovably than before ; and though on some
future day the same spiritual thunder be made to play
around you, it will not shake you out of the obstinacy
of your determined rebellion.

It is the universal law of habit, that the feelings are
always getting more faintly and feebly impressed by
ever} 7 repetition of the cause which excited them, and



INTRODUCTION. 23

tha* the mind i<s always getting etrongcr in its active
resistance to the impulse of these feelings, by every
new deed of resistance which it performs ; and thus it
is, that if you refuse us now, we have no other pros-
pect before us than that your course is every day
getting more desperate and more irrecoverable, your
souls are getting more hardened, the Spirit is getting
mor**, provoked to abandon those who have so long
persisted in their opposition to his movements. God,
who says that h^s Spirit shall not always strive with
man, is getting more offended. The tyranny of habit
is getting every day a firmer ascendancy over you;
Satan is getting you more helplessly involved among
his wiles and his entanglements; the world, with all
the inveteracy of those desires winch are opposite to
the will of the Father, is more and more lording it
over your every affection. And what, we would ask,
what is the scene in which you are now purposing to
contest it, with all this mighty force of opposition you
are now so busy in raising up against you ? What is
the field of combat to which you are now looking
forward, as the place where you are to accomplish a
victory over all those formidable enemies whom you
are at present arming with such a weight of hostility,
as, we say, within a single hairbreadth of certainty,
you will find to be irresistible? O the bigness of such
a misleading infatuation 1 The proposed scene in
I which this battle for eternity is to be fought, and this
\ictory for the crown of glory is to be won, is a death-
bed. It is when the last messenger stands by the
couch of the dying man, and shakes at him the ter-
rors of his grisly countenance, that the poor child of
infatuation thinks he is to struggle and prevail against
all his enemies; against the unrelenting tyranny of
habit — against the obstinacy of his own heart, which

he is now doing bo much to harden — against the
Spirit of God who perhaps long ere now lias pro-
nounced the doom upon him, " He will take his own
way, and walk in his own counsel ; I shall cease from
striving, and let him alone "—against Satan, to whom
every day of his life he has given some fresh advan-
tage over him, and who will not be willing to lose
ihe victim on whom he has practised so many wiles,
and plied Avith success so many delusions. And such
are the enemies whom you, who wretchedly calculate
on the repentance of the eleventh hour, are every day
mustering up in greater force and formidablenesa
against you ; and how can we think of letting you
go with any other repentance than the repentance of
the precious moment that is now passing over you,
when we look forward to the horrors of that impressive
scene on which you propose to win the prize of im-
mortality, and to contest it singlehanded and alone,
with all the weight of opposition which you have
accumulated against yourselves — a deathbed — a lan-
guid, breathless, tossing, and agitated deathbed; that
scene of feebleness, when the poor man cannot help
himself to a single mouthful — when he must have
attendants to sit around him, and watch his every
. wish, and interpret his every signal, and turn him to
every posture where he may find a moment's ease,
and wipe aw?\y the cold sweat that is running over
him — and ply him with cordials for thirst, and sick-
ness, and insufferable languor. And this is the time,
"when occupied with such feelings, and beset with
such agonies as these, you propose to crowd within
the compass of a few wretched days the work ol
winding up the concerns of a neglected eternity!

impracticable performance, as a change of mind, in
what rational way can it be made the subject of a
precept or injunction? you would not call upon the
Ethiopian to change his skin — you would not call
upon the leopard to change his spots j and yet you call
upon us to change our minds. You say, " Repent ;"
and that too in the face of the undeniable doctrine, that
man is without strength for the achievement of so
mighty an enterprise. Can you tell us any plain and
practicable thing that you would have us tD perform,
and that we may perform, to help on this business?"
This is the very question with which the hearers of
John the Baptist came back upon him, after he had
told them in general terms to repent, and to bring forth
fruits meet for repentance. He may not have resolved
the difficulty, but he pointed the expectation of his
countrymen to a greater than he for the solution of it.
Now that Teacher has already come, and we live
under the full and the finished splendor of his revela-
tion. O that the greatness and difficulty of the work
of repentance had the effect of shutting you up into
the faith of Christ ! Repentance is not a paltry, super-
ficial reformation. It reaches deep into the inner man,
but not too deep for the searching influences of that
Spirit which is at his giving, and which worketh
mightily in the hearts of believers. You should go
then under a sense of your difficulty to Him. Seek
to be rooted in the Savior, that you may be nourished
out of his fulness, and strengthened by iiis might.
The simple cry for a clean heart, and a right spirit,
which is raised from the mouth of a believer, brings
down an answer from on high which explains all the
difficulty and overcomes it. And if what we have
eaid of the extent and magnitude of repentance, should
have the effort to give a deeper feeling than before of

the wants under which you labor ; and shall dispose
you to seek after a closer and more habitual urnon
with Him who alone can supply them, then will our
call to repent have indeed fulfilled upon you the ap-
pointed end of a preparation for the Savior. But re-
collect now is your time, and now is your opportunity,
for entering on the road of preparation that leads to
heaven. We charge you to enter this road at this
moment, as you value your deliverance from hell, and
your possession of that blissful place where you shall
be for ever with the Lord — we charge you not to
parry and to delay this matter, no not for a single
hour — we call on you by all that is great in eternity —
by all that is terrifying in its horrors — by £.11 that ia

authority of God — by all that is condemning in the

vate this condemnation in the insulting contempt of
his rejected gospel ; — we call on you by one and ah
of these considerations, not to hesitate, but to flee —
not to purpose a return for to-morrow, but to make
an actual return this very day — to put a decisive end
to every plan of wickedness on which you may havw
entered — to cease your hands from all that is ibrbid-
den — to turn them to all that is required — to betake
yourselves to the appointed Mediator, and receive
through him, by the prayer of faith, -such constant
supplies of the washing of regeneration and renewing
of the Holy Ghost, that, from this moment, you may
be carried forward from one degree of grace unto
another, and from a life devoted to God here, to the
elevation of a triumphant, and the joys of a blissfirl

THE GREAT SUCCESS WHICH ATTENDED THE
CALL WHEN FIRST PUBLISHED.

It may be proper lo prefix an account of this book given
by Mr. Baxter himself, which was found in his study, after
bis death, in his own words:

" I published a short treatise on conversion, entitled, A
Call to the Unconverted. The occasion of this was my
converse with Bishop Usher while I was at London; who,
approving my method and directions for Peace of Con-
science, was importunate with me to write directions
suited to the various states of Christians, and also agains*
particular sins. I reverenced the man, but disregardea
these persuasions, supposing I could do nothing but what
is done better already: but when he was dead, his words
went deeper to my mind, and I purposed to obey his coun-
sel; yet, so as that to the first sort of men, the ungodly,
1 thought vehement persuasions meeter than directions
only, and so for such I published this little book, which
God hath blessed with unexpected success, beyond all the
rest that I have written, except The Saint's Rest. In a
little more than a year there were about twenty thousand
of them printed by my own consent, and about ten thou-
sand since, beside many thousands by stolen impressions,
which poor men stole for lucre's sake. Through God's
mercy I have information of almost whole households
converted by this small book which I set so light by; and,
as if all this in England, Scotland, and Ireland, were not
mercy enough to me, God, since I was silenced, hath sent
it over in life message to many beyond the seas ; xor when



30 ADVERTISEMENT.

Mr. Elliot bad printed all the Bible in tbe Indian language,
be next translated this my Call to the Unconverted, as he
wrote to us here. And yet God would make some farther
use of it ; for Mr. Stoop, tbe pastor of the French Churcb
in London, being driven hence by the displeasure of hi»
superiors, was pleased to translate it into French. I hopf
it will not be unprofitable there; nor in Germany, when
also it has been printed."

It may be proper further to mention Dr. Bates' account
of the author, and of this useful treatise. In his sermon
at Mr. Baxter's funeral, he thus says: 'His books of
practical divinity have been effectual for more conver-
sions of sinners to God than any printed in our time : and
while the churcb remains on earth, will be of continual
efficacy to recover lost souls. There is a vigorous pulse
in thern, that keeps the reader awake and attentive. His
Call to the Unconverted, how small in bulk, but how
powerful in virtue ! Truth speaks in it with that authority
and efficacy, that it makes the reader to lay his hand upon
bis heart, and find that he has a soul and a conscience,
though he lived before as if he had none. He told some
friends, that six brothers were converted by reading that
Call; and that every week he received letters of some
converted by his books. This he spake witb most hum-
ble thankfulness, that God was pleased to use him as an
instrument for the salvation of souls."



A CALJL,
TO THS UNCONVERTED.



EZEKIEL, XXXIII. 11.

Say unto them, As Hive, saith the Lord God, Ihavt
no pleasure in the death of the wicked; bid thai
the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye*
turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die,
O house of Israeli

Jr hath been the astonishing wonder of many a
man as well as me, to read in the Holy Scriptures how
few will be saved, and that the greatest part even of
those that are called, will be everlastingly shut out of
the kingdom of heaven, and be tormented with the
devils in eternal fire. Infidels believe not this when
they read it, and therefore they must feel it ; those
that do believe it are forced to cry out with Paul,
(Rom. 11. 13,) " O the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable
are his judgments, and his ways past finding out !"
But nature itself doth teach us all to lay the blame
of evil works upon the doers ; and therefore when we
see any heinous thing done, a principle of justice doth
provoke us to inquire after him that did it, that the
evil of the work may return the evil of shame upon
the author. If we saw a man killed and cut in pieces
by the way, we would presently ask, Oh ! who did
this cruel deed? If the town was wilfully set on fire,
you would ask, what wicked wretch did this? So
when we read that many souls will be miserable in
hell for ever, we must needs think with ourselves, how
somes this to pass? and whose fault is it? Who is it



32 A CALL TO Doct. 1.

that is so cruel as to be the cause of such a thing as
ihis? and we can meet with few that will own the
guilt. It is indeed confessed by all, that Satan is the
cause; but that doth not resolve the doubt, because
lie is not the principal cause. He doth not force men
to sin, but tempts them to it, and leaves it to their
own wills whether they will do it or not. He doth not
carry men to an alehouse and force open their mouths
and pour in the drink ; nor doth he hold them that
they cannot go to God's service ; nor doth he force
their hearts from holy thoughts. It lieth therefore
between God himself and the sinner ; one of them
must needs be the principal cause of all this misery,
whichever it is, for there is no other to lay it upon;
and God disclaimeth it ; he will not take it upon him ;
and the wicked disclaim it usually, and they will not
take it upon them, and this is the controversy that is
here managing in my text.

The Lord complaineth of the people ; and the peo-
ple think it is the fault of God. The same controversy
is handled, chap. 18. 25: they plainly say, " that the
way of the Lord is not equal." So here they say,
verse 19, " If our transgressions and our sins be upon
us, and we pine away in them, how shall we then
live?-' As if they should say, if we must die, and be
miserable, how can we help it ? as if it were not theii
fault, but God's. But God, in my text, doth clem
himself of it, and telleth them how they may help h
if they will, and persuadeth them to use the means,
and if they will not be persuaded, he lets them know
that it is the fault of themselves ; and if this will not
satisfy them, he will not forbear to punish them. It is
he that will be the Judge, and he will judge them
according to their ways ; they are no judge of hirn

or of themselves, as wanting authority, and wisdom,
and impartiality ; nor is it tlie cavilling and quarrelling
with God that shall serve their turn, or save them
from the execution of justice, at which they murmur.
The words of this verse contain, 1. God's purgation
or clearing himself from the blame of their destruction.
This he doth not by disowning his law, that the
wicked shall die, nor by disowning his judgments and
execution according to that law, or giving them any
hope that the law shall not be executed ; but by pro-
fessing that it is not their death that he takes pleasure
in, but their returning rather, that they may live ; and
tliis he confirmeth to them by his oath. 2. An ex-
press exhortation to the wicked to return; wherein
God doth not only command, but persuade and con-
descend also to reason the case with them; Why will
they die ? The direct end of this exhortation is, that
they may turn and live. The secondary or reserved
ends, upon supposition that this is not attained, are
these two : First, To convince them by the means
which he used, that it is not the fault of God if they
be miserable. Secondly, To convince them from
their manifest wilfulness in rejecting all his commands
and persuasions, that it is the fault of themselves, and
they die, even because they will die.

The substance of the text doth lie in these observa-
tions following : —

Doctrine 1 . It is the unchangeable law of God, that
wicked men must turn or die.

Doctrine 2. It is the promise of God, that the wicked
shall live, if they will but turn.

Doctrine 3. God takes pleasure in men's conversion
and salvation, but not in their death or damnation: ho



34 A CALL TO Doct. I

had rather they would return and live, than go on
and die.

Doctrine 4. This is a most certain truth, which
because God would not have men to question, he hath
confirmed it to them solemnly by his oath.

Doctrine 5. The Lord doth redouble his commands
and persuasions to the wicked to turn.

Doctrine 6. The Lord condescendeth to reason the
case with them ; and asketh the wicked why they
will die?

Doctrine 7. If after all this the wicked will not turn,
it is not the fault of God that they perish, but of them-
selves; their own wilfulness is the cause of their
own damnation ; they therefore die because they
will die.

Having laid the text open in these propositions, I
shall next speak somewhat of each of them in order,
though briefly.

DOCTRINE I.

It is the unchangeable laic of God, that wicked
men must turn, or die.

If yon will believe God, believe this : there is but
one of these two ways for every wicked man, either
conversion or damnation. I know the wicked will
hardly be persuaded either of the truth or equity of
this. No wonder if the guilty quarrel with the law.
Few men are apt to believe that which they would
not have to be true, and fewer would have that to be
true which they apprehended to be against, them. But
it is not quarrelling with the law, or with the judge,
that will save the malefactor. Believing and regard-
ing the law, might have prevented his death ; but
denying and accusing it will but hasten it. If it were



OocC I. THE UNCONVERTED. 85

Tiot so, a hundred would bring their reason against the
law, for one that would bring his reason to the law,
and men would rather choose to give their reasons
why they should not be punished, than to hear the
commands and reasons of their governors which re-
quire them to obey. The law was not made for you to
judge, but that you might be ruled and judged by it.

But if there be any so blind as to venture to ques-
tion either the truth or the justice of this law of God,
I shall briefly give you that evidence of both which
methinks, should satisfy a reasonable man.

And first, if you ijpubt whether this be the word of
God, or not, besides a hundred other texts, you may
be satisfied by these few:— Matt. 18: 3. "Verily I
say unto you, except ye be converted and become as
little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of
God." John 3:3. " Verily, verily, I say unto you,
except a man be born again he cannot see the king-
dom of God." 2 Cor. 5: 17. ll If any man be in Christ,
he is a new creature ; old things are passed away ;
behold, all things are become new." Col. 3: 9, 10.
"Ye have put off the old man with his -deeds, and
have put on the new man, which is renewed in know-
ledge alter the image of him that, created him.' Heb.
12: 14. " Without holiness no man shall see the
Lord." Rom. 8: 8, 9. "So then they that are in the
flesh cannot please God. Now if any man have not the
spirit of Christ, he is none of his." Gal. 6: 15. "For
in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any
thing, nor uncircumcibion, but a new creature." 1 Pet.
1:3. " According to hie abundant grace he hath be-
gotten us to a lively hope." Ver. 23. ."Being born
again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
the word of God, wnich liveth and abideth for ever."



36 A CALL to Dact. I

1 Pet. 2: 1, 2. "Wherefore laying aside all malice.
and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and evi]
speaking, as new born babes, detare the sincere milk
of the word, that ye may grow thereby." Psalm 9:
17. " The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all thr
nations that forget God." Psalm 11 f 4. "And tin.
Lord lcveth the righteous, but the wicked his sou/
liateth."

As I need not stay to open these texts which are
so plain, so I think I need not add any more of that
multitude which speak the like. If thou be a man
that dost believe the Word of God, here is already
enough to satisfy thee that the wicked must be con-
verted or condemned. You are already brought so
far, that you must either confess that this is true, or
say plainly, you will not believe the word of God.
And if once you be come to that pass, there is but
small hopes of you : look to yourself as well as you
can, for it is like you will not be long out of hell. You
would be ready to fly in the face of him that should
give you the lie ; and yet dare you give the lie to
God? But if you tell God plainly you will not believe
him, blame him not if he never warn you more, or if
he forsake you, and give you up as hopeless ; for to
what purpose should he warn you, if you will not be-
lieve him ? Should he send an angel from heaven to
you, it seems you would not believe. For an angel
can speak but the word of God ; and if an angel should
bring you any other gospel, you are not to receive it
but to hold him accursed. Gal. 1 : 8. And surely there
is no angel to be believed before the Son of God, who
came from the Father to bring us this doctrine. If He
be not to be believed, then all the angels in heaven
are not to be believed. And if you stand on theao



0ocV i. THE UNCONVERTED. 37

terms with God, I shall leave you till he deal with you
in a more convincing way. God hath a voice that
will make you hear. Though he entreat you to hear
the voice of Lis gospel, he will make you hear the
vDice of his condemning sentence, without entreaty.
We cannot make you believe against your wills ; but
God will make you feel against your wills.

But let us hear what reason you have why you will
oot believe this word of God, which tells us that the
wicked must be converted, or condemned. I know
your reason ; it is because that you judge it unlikely
that God should be so unmerciful : you think it cruelty
to damn men everlastingly for so small a tiling as a
sinful life. And this leads us to the second thing,
which is to justify the equity of God in Ms laws and
judgments.

And first, I think you will not deny that it is most
suitable to an immortal soul to be ruled by laws that
promise an immortal reward, and threaten an endless
punishment. Otherwise the law should not be suited
to the nature of the subject, who will not be fully
ruled by any lower means than the hopes or fears of
everlasting ihings : as it is in cases of temporal pun-
ishment, if a law were now made that the most hei-
nous crimes shall be punished with a hundred years'
captivity, this might be of some efficacy, as being
^qual to our lives. But, if there had been no other
penalties before the flood, when men lived eight or
nine hundred years, it would not have been sufficient,
because men would know that they might have so
many hundred years impunity afterward. So it is
in our present case.

2. I suppose that you will confess, that the promise
of an endless and inconceivable priory is not so unsuit-

38 A CALL TO Doct k

abb to the wisdom of God, or the case of man : ana
why then should you not think so of the threatening
of an endless and unspeakable misery !

3. When you find it in the word of God that so il
is, and so it will be, do ye think yourselves fit to con-
tradict this word ? Will you call your Maker to the
bar, and examine his word upon the accusation of
falsehood? Will you sit upon him and judge him by
the law of your conceits ? Are you wiser, and better,
and more righteous than he? Must the God of heaven
come to school to you to learn wisdom 1 Must Infinite
Wisdom learn of folly, and Infinite Goodness be cor-
rected by a sinner that cannot keep himself an hour
clean? Must the Almighty stand at the bar of a
worm? O horrid arrogancy of senseless dust! shall
ever mole, or clod, or dunghill, accuse the sun of dark-
ness, and undertake to illuminate the world ? Where
were you when the Almighty made the laws, that
he did not call you to his counsel ? Surely he made
them before you were born, without desiring your
advice ; and you came into the world too late to re-
verse them, if you could have done so great a work.
You should have stepped out of your nothingness and
have contradicted Christ when he was on earth, or
Moses before him, or have saved Adam and his sinful
progeny from the threatened death, that eo there
might have been no need of Christ. And what if
God withdraw his patience and sustaining power, and
let you drop into hell while you are quarrelling with
his w T ord, will you then believe that there is a hell ?

4, If sin be such an evil that it requireth the death
of Christ for its expiation, no w-onder if it deserve our
everlasting misery.



Ooct. 1. THE UNCONVERTED. 39

5. And if the sin of the devils deserved an endless
torment, why not also the sin of man ?

6. And methinks you should perceive that it is not
possible for the best of men, much less for the wicked,
to be competent jud ges of the desert of sin. Alas ! we
are both blind and partial. You can never know fully
Lhe desert of sin, till you fully know the evil of sin;
and you can never fully know the evil of sin, till you
folly know, 1. The excellency cf the soul which it
deformeth. 2. And the excellency of holiness which
it obliterates. 3. The reason and excellency of the
law which it violates. 4. The excellency of the
glory which it despises. 5. The excellency and of-
fice of reason which it treadeth down. 6. No, nor till
you know the infinite excellency, al mightiness and
holiness of that God against whom it is committed.
When you fully know all these, you shall fully know
the desert of sin besides. You know that the offender
is too partial to judge the law, or the proceeding of
his judge. We judge by feeling which blinds our
reason. We see, in common worldly things, that most
men think the cause is right which is their own, and
that ail is wrong that is done against them ; and let
•_he most wise or just impartial friends persuade. them
to the contrary, and it is all in vain. There are few
children but think the father is unmerciful, or dealeth
hardly with them if he whip them. There is scarce
the vilest wretch but thinketh the church doth wrong
him if they excommunicate him : or scarce a thief or
murderer that is hanged, but would accuse the law
and judge of cruelty, if that would serve their turn.

7. Can you think that an unholy soul is fit for
heaven? Alas, they cannot love God here, nor do him
any service wmich he can accept. They are contrary



40 a CALL TO Doct. 1.

to God, they loathe that which he moyt loveth, and
love that which he abhorreth. They are incapable
of that imperfect communion with Him which his
saints here partake of. How then can they live in
ihat perfect love of him, and full delight and com-
munion with him, which is the blessedness of heaven?
Fou do not accuse yourselves of unmerciful ness, if
you make not your enemy your bosom counsellor ; or
if you take not your swine to bed and board with you :
no, nor if you take away his life though he never sin-
ned ; and yet you will blame the absolute Lord, the
most wise and gracious Sovereign of the world, if he
condemn the unconverted to perpetual misery.

Use. — I beseech you now, all that love your souk,
that, instead of quarrelling with God and with his
word, you will presently receive it, and use it for your
good. All you that are yet unconverted, take this as the
undoubted truth of God : — You must, ere long, be con-
verted or condemned ; there is no other way but to
turn, or die. When God, that cannot lie, hath told
you this; when you hear it from the Maker and
Judge of the world, it is time for him that hath ears,
to hear. By this time you may see what you have
to trust to. You are but dead and damned men, ex-
cept you will be converted. Should I tell you other-
wise, I should deceive you with a lie. Should I hide
this from you, I should undo you, and be guilty of your
blood, as the verses before my text assure me. — Verse
8. " When I say to the wicked man, O wicked man,
thou shalt surely die ; if thou dost not speak to warn
the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in
his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine
hand." You see then, though this be a rough and
unwelcome doctrine, it is such as we must preach, and



Doct. 1. THE UNCONVERTED. 41

you must hear. It is easier to hear of hell than feel
it. If your necessities did not require it, we wculd
not gall your tender ears with truths that seem so
harsh and grievous. Hell would not be so full, if peo-
ple were but willing to know their case, and to hear
and think of it. The reason why so few escape it, is
because they strive not to enter in at the strait gate of
conversion, and go the narrow way of holiness, while
they have time : and they strive not, because they are
not awakened to a lively feeling of the danger they
are in ; and they are not awakened because they are
loth to hear or think of it : and that is partly through
foolish tenderness and carnal self-love, and partly be-
cause they do not well believe the word that threat-
ened it. If you will not thoroughly believe this truth,
methinks the weight of it should lbrce you to remem-
ber it, and it should follow you, and give you no rest
till you are converted. If you had b^t once /»eard
this word by the voice of an angel, " Thou nvtisi be
converted, or condemned : turn, or die :" would it mt
stick in your mind, and haunt you night and day? so
that in your sinning you would remember it, as if the
voice were still in your ears, " Turn, or die !" O hap-
py were your soul if it might thus work with you and
never be forgotten, or let you alone till it have driven
home your heart to God. But if you will cast it out
by forgetfuli: ss or unbelief how can it work to your
conversion an A salvation 1 But take this with you to
your sorrow, though you may put this out of 3 r our
mind, you cannot put it out of the Bible, but there
it will stand as a sealed truth, which you shall expe-
rimentally know for ever, that there is no other way
but, "turn, 01 die,"

what is the matter then that the hearts of si'J-



42 A CALL TO Doct. 1

ners are not pierced with such a weighty truth ? A
man would think now, that every unconverted soul
that hears these words should be pricked to the heart,
and think with himself, ' This is my own case,' ar d
never be quiet till he found himself converted. Believe
it, this drowsy careless temper will not last long. Con-
version and condemnation are both of them awaken •
ing things, and one of them will make you feel ere
long. I can foretell it as truly as if I saw it with my
eyes, that either grace or hell will shortly bring these
matters to the quick, and make you say, " What have
I done? what a foolish wicked course have I taken?"
The scornful and the stupid state of sinners will last
but a little while : as soon as they either turn or die,
the presumptuous dream will be at an end, and then
their wits and feeling will return.

But I foresee there are two things that are likely tc
harden the unconverted, and make me lose all my
labor, except they can be taken out of the way ; and
that is the misunderstanding on those two words, the
wicked and turn. Some will think to themselves,
* It is true, the wicked must turn or die ; but what is
that to me, I am not wicked ; though I am a sinner,
all men arc.' Others will think, ' It is true that we
must turn from our evil ways, but I am turned long
ago ; I hope this is not now to do.* And thus while
wicked men think they are not wicked, but are al-
ready converted, we lose all our labor in persuading
them to turn. I shall therefore, before I go any fur-
ther, tell you here who are meant by the wicked j
and who they are that must turn or die; and also
what is meant by turning, and who they are that are
truly converted. And this I have purposely reserved
for th ; s place, preferring the method that fits my end



Doct.1. THE UNCONVERTED. 43

And here you may observe, that in the sense of the
text, a wicked man and a converted man are contra-
ries. No man is a wicked man that is converted ; and
no man is a converted man that is wicked ; so that to
be a wicked man and to be an unconverted man, is
all one ; and therefore in opening one, we shall open
both.

Before I can tell you what either wickedness or con-
version is, I mu^t go to the bottom, and fetch up the,
matter from the beginning.

It pleased the great Creator of the world to make
ihree sorts of living creatures. Angels he made pure
spirits without flesh, and therefore he made them only
for heaven, and not to dwell on earth. Brutes were
made flesh, without immortal souls, and therefore
they were made only for earth, and not for heaven.
Man is of a middle nature, between both, as partak-
ing of both flesh and spirit, and therefore he was made
both for heaven and earth. But as his flesh is made
to be but a servant to his spirit, so is he made for earth
but as his passage or way to heaven, and not that this
should be his home or happiness. The blessed state
that man was made for, was to behold the glorious
majesty of the Lord, and to praise him among his
Holy Angels, and to love him, and to be filled with
his love for ever. And as this was the end that man
was made for, so God did give him means that were
fitted to the attaining of it. These means were prin-
cipally two : First, the right inclination and disposi-
tion of the mind of man. Secondly, The right order-
ing of his life and practice. For the first, God suited
the disposition of man unto his end, giving him such
knowledge of God as was fit for his present state, and
a heart disposed and inclined to God in holy love. But



44 A CALL TO Doct -

yet he did not fix or confirm him in this condition, but,
having made him a free agent, lie left him in the
hands of his own free will. For the second, God did
that which belonged to him ; that is, he gave him a
perfect law, required him to continue in the love of
God, and perfectly to obey him. By the wilful breach
of this law, man did not only forfeit his hopes of ever-
lasting life, but also turned his heart from God, and
fixed it on these lower fleshly things, and hereby blot-
ted out the spiritual image of God from his soul ; so
that man did both fall short of the glory of God, which
was his end, and put himself out of the way by which
he should have attained it, and this both as to the
frame of his heart, and of his life. The holy inclina-
tion and love of his soul to God, he lost, and instead
of it he contracted an inclination and love to the plea-
sing of his flesh, or carnal self, by earthly things ;
growing strange to God and acquainted with the
creature. And the course of this life was suited to
the bent and inclination of his heart ; he lived to his
carnal self, and not to God ; he sought the creature,
for the pleasing of his flesh, instead of seeking to please
the Lord. With this nature or corrupt inclination,
we are all now born into the world ; " for who can
bring a clean thing out of an unclean ?" Job, 14 : 4.
As a lion hath a fierce and cruel nature before he doth
devour; and an adder hath a venomous nature before
she sting, so in our infancy we have those sinful na-
tures or inclinations, before we think, or speak, or do
amiss. And hence springeth all the sin of our lives;
and not only so, but when God hath, of his mercy, pro-
vided us a remedy, even the Lord Jesus Christ, to be
the Savior of our souls, and bring us back to God
again, we naturally love our present state, and are



Doct. 1. THE UNCONVERTED. 45

loth to be brought out of it, and therefore are set
against the means of our recovery: and though cus-
tom hath taught us to thank Christ for his good-will,
j r et carnal self persuades us to refuse his remedies, and
to desire to be excused when we are commanded to
take the medicines which he offers, and are called to
forsake all and follow him to God and glory.

I pray you read over this leaf again, and mark it ;
for in these few words you have a true description of
our natural state, and consequently of wicked man ;
for every man that is in the state of corrupted nature
is a wicked man, and in a state of death.

By this also you are prepared. to understand what
it is to be converted : to which end you must further
know, that the mercy of God, not willing that man
should perish in his sin, provided a remedy, by caus-
ing his Son to take our nature, and being, in one per-
son, God and man, to become a mediator between
God and man ; and by dying for our sins on the cross,
to ransom us from the curse of God and the power of
the devil. And having thus redeemed us, the Father
hath delivered us into his hands as his own. Here-
upon the Father and the Mediator do make a new
law and covenant for man, not like the first, which
gave life to none but the perfectly obedient, and con-
demned man for every sin ; but Christ hath made a
law of grace, or a promise of pardon and everlasting
life to all that, by true repentance, and by faith in
Christ, are converted unto God ; like an act of oblivion,
which is made by a prince to a company of rebels, on
condition they will lay down their arms and come in
and be loyal subjects for the time to come.

But, because the Lord knoweth that the heart of
man is grown so wicked, that, for all this, men will



46 A CALL TO Oot/L 1

not accept of the remedy if they be left to themselves
therefore the Holy Ghost hath undertaken it as hia
office to inspire the Apostles, and seal the Scriptures
by miracles and wonders, and to illuminate and con-
vert the souls of the elect.

So by this much you see, that as there are three
persons in the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, so each of these persons have their several
works, which are eminently ascribed to them.

The Father's works were, to create us, to rule us,
as his rational creatures, by the law of nature, and
judge us thereby; and in mercy to provide us a Re-
deemer when we were lost ; and to send his Son, and
accept his ransom.

The works of the Son for us were these : to ransom
and redeem us by his suffering and righteousness; ; to
give out the promise or law of grace, and rule and
judge the world as their Redeemer, on terms of grace :
and to make intercession for us, that the benefits of his
death may be communicated ; and to send the Holy
Ghost, which the Father also doth by the Son.

The works of the Holy Ghost, for us, are these : to
indite the Holy Scriptures, by inspiring araJ guiding
the Apostles, and sealing the word, by his miraculous
gifts and works, and the illuminating and exciting the
ordinary ministers of the gospel, and so enabling them
and helping them to publish that word; and by the
same word illuminating and converting the souls of
men. So that as you could not have been reasonable
creatures, if the Father had not created you, nor have
had any access to God, if the Son bad not died, so
neither can you have a part in Christ, or be saved,
except the Holy Ghost do sanctify you.

So that by this time you may see the several causes



Doct. 1. TOE UNCONVERTED. 47

of this work. The Father sendeth the Son : the Son
redeemeth us and maketh the promise of grace : the
Holy Ghost inditeth and sealeth this Gospel: the
Apostles are the secretaries of the Spirit to write it:
the preachers of the Gospel to proclaim it, and per-
suade men to open it : and the Holy Ghost doth make
their preaching effectual, by opening the hearts of
men to entertain it. And all this to repair the image
of God upon the soul, and to ml the heart upon God
again, and take it off the creature and carnal self to
which it is revolted, and so to turn the current of the
life Into a heavenly course, which before was earthly ;
and through this, embracing Christ by faith, who is
me Physician of the soul.

By what I have said, you may see what it is to be
wicked, and what it is to be converted ; which, I think,
will yet be plainer to you, if I describe them as con-
sisting of their several parts^ And fcr the first, a wicked
man may be known by these three things :

First, He is one who placeth his chief affections on
garth, and loveth the creature more than God, and
his fleshly prosperity above the heavenly felicity. He
savoreth the things of the flesh, but neither discern-
eth n&r savoreth the things of the Spirit; though he
will say, that heaven is better thars earth, yet he doth
not really so esteem it to himself. If he might be sure
of earth, he would let go heaven, and had rather stay
here than be removed thither. A life of perfect holi-
ness in the sight of God, and in his love and praisea
for ever in heaven, doth not find such liking with his
heart as a life of health, and wealth, and honor here
upon earth. And though he falsely profess thai he
loves God above all, yet indeed he never felt the power
of divine love within him, but his mind is more set on



48 A CALL TO Doci. I

worldly or fleshly pleasures than on God. In a word,
whoever loves earth above heaven, and fleshly pros-
perity more than God, is a wicked unconverted man.

On the other hand, a converted man is illuminated
to discern the loveliness of God, and so far believeth
the glory that is to be had with God, that his heart
is taken up with it and set more upon it than any
thing in this world. He had rather see the face of
God, and live in his ev^iasting love and praises, than
have all the wealth or pleasures of the world. He
seeth that all things else are vanity, and nothing but
God can fill the soul ; and therefore let the world go
which way it will, he layeth up his treasures and
hopes in heaven, and for that he is resolved to let go
all. As the fire doth mount upward, and the needle
that is touched with the loadstone still turns to the
north, so the converted soul is inclined unto God. No-
thing else can satisfy him : nor can he find any con-
tent and rest but in his love. In a word, all that are
converted do esteem and love God better than all the
tcorld, and the heavenly felicity is dearer to them
than their fleshly prosperity. The proof of what I
have said you may find in these places of Scriptures:
Phil. 3: 18, 21. Matt. 6 : 19, 20, 21. Col. 3 : 1, 4.
Rom. 8 : 5, 9, 18, 23. Psalm 73 : 25, 26.

Secondly, A wicked man is one that makes ft the
principal business of his life to prosper in the world,
and attain his fleshly ends. And though he may read,
and hear, end do much in the outward duties oC reli-
gion, and forbear disgraceful sins, yet this is all but
by-the-by, and he never makes it the principal busi-
ness of his life to please God, and attain everlast-
ing glory, and puts off God with the leavings of the
world, and gives him no more service than the flesh



Doct L THE UNCONVERTED. 40

can spare, for he will not part with all for heaven.

On the contrary, a converted man is one that makes
it the principal care and business of his life to please
God, and to be saved, and takes all the blessings of
this life but as accommodations in his journey toward
another life, and useth the creature in subordination
to God j he loves a holy life, and longs to be more
holy ; he hath no sin but what he hateth, and longeth,
and prayeth, and striveth to be rid of. The drift and
bent of his life is for God, and if he sin, it is contrary
to the very bent of his heart and life ; and therefore he
riseth again and lamenteth it, and dares not wilfully
live in any imown sin. There is nothing in this world
go dear to him but he can. give it up to God, and for-
sake it for him and the hopes of glory. AH this you
may see in Col. 3 : 1, 5. Matt. 6 : 20, 33. Luke, 18 :
22, 23, 29. Luke, 14 : 18, 24, 26, 27. Rom. 8 : 13.
Gal. 5 : 24. Luke 12 : 21, &c.

Thirdly, The soul of a wicked man did never truly
discern and relish the mystery of redemption, nor
thankfully entertain an offered Savior, nor is he taken
up with the love of the Redeemer, nor willing to be
ruled by him as the Physician of his soul, that he may
be saved from the guilt and power of his sins, and re-
covered to God ; but his heart is insensible of this un-
speakable benefit, and is quite against the healing
means by which he should be recovered. Though he
may be willing to be outwardly religious, yet he never
resigns up Ins soul to Christ, and to the motions and
conduct of his word and Spirit.

On the contrary, the converted soul having felt
himself undone by sin, and perceiving that he hath
lost his peace with God and hopes of heaven, and is in
danger of everlasting misery, doth tliankfallv enter-

Bas. Call. s



50 A CALL TO Doct. 1

tain the tidings of redemption, and believing in the
Lord Jesus as his only Savior, resigns himself up to
him for wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and re-
demption. He takes Christ as the life of his soul, and
lives by him, and uses him as a salve for every sore,
admiring the wisdom and love of God in this wonder-
ful work of man's redemption. In a word, Christ doth
even dwell in his heart by faith, and the life that he
now liveth, is by the faith of the Son of God, that
loved him, and gave himself for him ; yea, it is not so
much he that liveth, as Christ in him. For these,
see Job, 1 : 11, 12; and 3 : 19, 20. Rom. 8 : 9. Phil.
3 : 7, 10. Gal. 2 : 2Q. Job, 15 : 2, 3, 4. 1 Cor. 1 : 20.
2:2.

You see now, in plain terms from the Word of God,
who are the wicked and who are the converted. Igno-
rant people think, that if a man be no swearer, nor
curser, nor railer, nor drunkard, nor fornicator, nor ex-
tortioner, nor wrong any body in his dealings, and if
he come to church and say his prayers, he cannot be
a wicked man. Or if a man that hath been guilty
of drunkenness, swearing, or gaming, or the like vices,
do but forbear them for the time to come, they think
that this is a converted man. Others think if a man
that hath been an enemy, and scorner at godliness,
do but approve it, and be hated for it by the wicked,
as the godly are, that this must needs be a converted
man. And some are so foolish as to think that they
are converted by taking up some new opinion, and
falling into some dividing party. And some think,
if they have but been affrighted by the fears of hell,
and had convictions of conscience, and thereupon
have purposed and promised amendment, and take up
a life of civil behavior and outward religion, that this



Doct. 1. THE UNCONVERTED. 51

must needs be true conversion. And these are the
poor deluded souls that are like to lose the benefit of
all our persuasions j and when they hear that the
wicked must turn or die, they think that this is not
3poken to them, for they are not wicked, but are turned
already. And therefore it is that Christ told some of
the rulers of the Jews who were greater and more
civil than the common people, that " publicans and
harlots go into the kingdom of Christ before them."
Matt. 21 : 31. Not that a harlot, or gross sinner can
be saved without conversion ; but because it was easier
to make these gross sinners perceive their sin and mi-
sery, and the necessity of a change, than the more
civil sort, who delude themselves by thinking that
they are converted already, when they are not.

O sirs, conversion is another kind of work than most
are aware of. It is not a small matter to bring an
earthly mind to heaven, and to show man the amiable
excellence of God, till he be taken up in such love to
him that can never be quenched ; to break the heart
for sin, and make him fly for refuge to Christ, and
thankfully embrace him as the life of his soul ; to have
the very drift and bent of the heart and life changed ;
so that a man renounceth that which he took for his
felicity, and placeth his felicity where he never did
before, and lives not to the same end, and drives not
on the same design in the world, as he formerly did.
In a word, he that is in Christ is a " new creature :
old things are passed aAvay : behold, all things are
become new." 2 Cor. 5 : 17. He hath a new under-
standing, a new will and resolution, new sorrows, and
desires, and love, and delight; new thoughts, new
speeches, new company, (if possible,) and a new con-
versation. Sin, that before was a jesting matter witj?



52 A CALL TO Doct. 1

him. is now so odious and terrible to him that he flies
from it as from death. The world, that was so lovely
in his eyes, doth now appear but as vanity and vexa-
tion : God, that was before neglected, is now the only
happiness of his soul : before he was forgotten, and
every lust preferred before him, but now he is set next
the heart, and all things must give place to him ; the
heart is taken up in the attendance and observance
of him, is grieved when he hides his face, and never
thinks itself well without him. Christ himself, that
was wont to be slightly thought of, is now his only
hope and refuge, and he lives upon him as on his
daily bread ; he cannot pray without him, nor rejoice
without him, nor think, nor speak, nor live without
him. Heaven itself, that before was looked upon but
as a tolerable reserve, which he hoped might serve
his turn better than hell, when lie could not stay any
longer in the world, is now taken for his home, the
place of his only hope and rest, where he shall see,
and love, and praise that God that hath his heart al-
ready. Hell, that did seem before but as a bugbear
to frighten men from sin, doth now appear to be a real
misery that is not to be ventured on, nor jested with.
The works of holiness, of which before he was weary,
and thought to be more than needful, are now both hie
recreation, and his business, and the trade that he live?
upon. The Bible, which was before to him but almost
as a common book, is now as the law of God ; as a let-
ter written to him, and subscribed with the name of
the Eternal Majesty ; it is the rule of his thoughts,
and words, and deeds ; the commands are binding, the
threats are dreadful, and the promises of it speak life
to his soul. The godly, that seemed to him but like
other men. are new the most excellent and happy on



Flact i. THE UNCONVERTED. 53

earth. And the wicked that were his playfellows are
now his grief; and he that could laugh at their sins
is readier now to weep for their sin and misery, and
to say with those of eld, (Psalm 16 : 3 ; 15 : 4. Phil.
3 : 18.) " But to the saints that are in the earth, and to
the excellent, in whom is all my delight." " In whose
eyes a vile person is contemned ; but he honoreth them
that fear the Lord : he that sweareth to his own hurt,
and changeth not." " For many walk, of whom I
have told you often, and now tell you, even weeping,
that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ." In
short, he hath a new end in his thoughts, and a new
way in his endeavors, and therefore his heart and life
are new. Before, his carnal self was his end, and his
pleasure and worldly profits and credit were his way ;
and now God and everlasting glory are his end, and
Christ, and the Spirit, and word, and ordinances. Ho-
liness to God, and righteousness and mercy to men,
these are his way. Before, self was the chief ruler,
to which the matters of God and conscience must
Btoop and give place ; and now God, in Christ, by the
Spirit, word and ministry, is the chief ruler, to whom
both self and all the matters of self must give place.
So that this is not a change in one, or two, or twenty
points, but in the whole soul, and in the very end and
bent of the conversation. A man may step out of one
path into another, and yet have his face the same
way, and be still going toward the same place j but it
is another matter to turn quite back, and take his
journey quite the contrary way, to a contrary place.
So it is here ; a man may turn from drunkenness, and
forsake other gross disgraceful sins, and set upon some
duties of religion, and yet be still going to the same end
as before, loving his carnal self above all, and giving
5*



&4 A CALL TG Doct 1.

it still the government of his soul ; but when he is con-
verted, this self is denied, and taken down, and God is
set up, and his face is turned the contrary way : and
he that before was addicted to himself, and lived to
himself, is now, by sanctification, devoted to God, and
liveth unto God. Belbre, he asked himself what he
should do with his time, his parts, and his estate, and
for himself he used them ; but now he asketh God
what he shall do with them, and useth them for him.
Before, he would please God so far as might accord
with the pleasure of his flesh and carnal self, but not
to any great displeasure of them ; but now he will
please God, let flesh and self be never so much dis-
pleased. This is the great change that God will make
upon all that shall be saved.

You can say, that the Holy Ghost is our sanctifier ;
but do you know what sanctification is ? Why, this
is what I have now opened to you ; and every man
and woman in the world must have this, or be con-
demned to everlasting misery. They must turn or die.

Do you believe all this, sirs, or do you not ? Surely
you dare not say you do not ; for it is past a doubt or
denial. These are not controversies, where one learned
pious man is of one mind, and another of another;
where one party saith this, and the other saith that.
Every sect among us that deserve to be called Chris-
tians are all agreed in this that I have said ; and if
you will not believe the God of truth, and that in a
case where every sect and party do believe him, you
are utterly inexcusable.

But if you do believe this, how comes it to pass that
you live so quietly in an unconverted state ? Do you
know that you are converted ? and can you find thia
wonderful change upon your souls ? Have you beei?



Dock 1. THE UNCONVERTED. 55

thus bora again, and made new? Are not these
strange matters to many of you, and such as you
never felt within yourselves? If you cannot tell the
day or week of your change, or the very sermon that
converted you, yet do you find that the work is done,
that such a change indeed there is, and that you have
such hearts as are before described ? Alas ! the most
do fellow their worldly business, and little trouble their
minds with such thoughts. And if they be restrained
from scandalous sins, and can say, " I am no whore-
monger, nor thief, nor curser, nor swearer, nor tippler,
nor extortioner ; I go to church, and say my prayers ;"
they think that this is true conversion, and they shall
be saved as well as any. Alas ! this is foolish cheat-
ing of yourselves. This is too much contempt of an
endless glory, and too gross neglect of your immortal
souls. Can you make so light of heaven and hell ?
Your corpse will shortly lie in the dust, and angels or
devils will presently seize upon your souls; and every
man or woman of you all will shortly be among other
company, and in another case than now you are.
You will dwell in these houses but a little longer ; you
will work in your shops and fields but a little longer;
you will sit in these seats and dwell on this earth but
a little longer ; you will see with these eyes, and hear
with these ears, and speak with these tongues, but a
little longer, till the resurrection-day; and can you
make shift to forget this? what a place will you
shortly be in of joy or torment ! what a sight will
you shortly see in heaven or hell ! O what thoughts
will shortly fill your hearts with unspeakable delight
or horror ! What work will you be employed in ! to
praise the Lord with saints and angels, or to cry out
in fire unquenchable, with devils ; and should all this



56 A CALL TO Doct. L

be forgotten ? And all this will be endless, and sealed
up by an unchangeable decree. Eternity, eternity
will be the measure of your joys or sorrows : and can
this be forgotten ? And all this is true, sirs, most cer-
tainly true. When you have gone up and down a
little longer, and slept and awaked a few times more,
you will be dead and gone, and find ail true that now
I tell you : and yet can you now so much forget it ?
You shall then remember that you had this call, and
that, this day, in this place, you were reminded of
these things, and perceive them matters a thousand
times greater than either you or I could here conceive ;
and yet shall they be now so much forgotten ?

Beloved friends, if the Lord had not awakened me
to believe and to lay to heart these things myself, I
should have remained in a dark and selfish state, and
have perished for ever ; but if he have truly made me
sensible of them, it will constrain me to compassionate
you as well as myself. If your eyes were so far opened
as to see hell, and you saw your neighbors that were
unconverted dragged thither with hideous cries;
though they were such as you accounted honest peo-
ple on earth, and feared no such danger themselves,
such a sight would make you go home and think ot
it, and think again, and make you warn all about you,
as that lost worldling, Luke 16 : 28, would have had
his brethren warned, lest they come to that place ot
torment. Why, faith is a kind of sight ; it is the eye
of the soul, the evidence of things not seen. If I be-
lieve God, it is next to seeing ; and therefore I beseech
you excuse me if I be half as earnest with you about
these matters as if I had seen them. If I must die
to-morrow, and it were in my power to come again
from another world, and tell you what I had seen,



Doeu 1. THE UNCONVERTED. 5*3

would you not be willing to hear me? and would you
not believe, and regard what I should tell you 1 If I
might preach one sermon to you after I am dead, and
have seen what is done in the world to come, would
you not have me plainly speak the truth, and would
you not crowd to hear me, and would you not lay it
to heart? But this must not be; God hath his ap-
pointed way of teaching you by Scriptures and mi-
nisters, and he will not humor unbelievers so far as to
send men from the dead to them, and alter his esta-
blished way; if any man quarrel with the sun, God
will not humor him so far as to set up a clearer light.
Friends, I beseech you regard me now as you would
do if I should come from the dead to you ; for I can
give you as full assurance of the truth of what I say
to you as if I had been there and seen it with my
eyes ; for it is possible for one from the dead to deceive
you; but Jems Christ can never deceive you; the
Word of God delivered in Scripture, and seaied by
miracles, and holy workings of the Spirit, can never
deceive you. Believe this or believe nothing. Be-
lieve and obey tins, or you are undone. Now, as ever
you believe the word of God, and as ever you care
for the salvation of your souls, let me beg of you this
reasonable request, and I beseech you deny me not :
That you would now remember what has been said,
and enter into an earnest search of your hearts, and
say to yourselves — Is it so indeed ; must I turn or die?
Must I be converted or condemned ? It is time for me
then to look about me before it be too late. O why did
not I look after this till now 7 Why did I venturously
put off or neglect so great a business ? Was I awake,
or in my wits ? O blessed God, what a mercy 13 it
that thou didst not cut off my life all this while, be-



58 A CALL TO Doct. L

ore I had any certain hope of eterr.al life ! Well,
God forbid that I should neglect this work any longer.
What state is my soul in ? Am I converted, or am I
not ? Was ever such a change or work done upon my
soul ? Have I been illuminated by the word and
Spirit of the Lord to see the odiousness of sin, th«
need of a Savior, the love of Christ, and the excel-
lences of God and glory ? Is my heart broken or hum-
bled within me for my former life ? Have I thank-
fully entertained my Savior and Lord that offered
himself with pardon and life for my soul ? Do I hate
my former sinful life and the remnant of every sin
that is in me ? Do I fly from them as my deadly ene-
mies? Do I give up myself to a life of holiness and
obedience to God? Do 1 love it and delight in it?
Can I truly say that I am dead to the world, and car-
nal self, and that I live for God and the glory which
he hath promised ? Hath heaven more of my esti-
mation and resolution than earth? And is God the
deadest and highest in my soul ? Once, I am sure, I
lived principally to the world and flesh, and God had
nothing but some heailless services, which the world
could spare, and which were the leavings of the flesh.
Is my heart now turned another way ? Have I a new
design and a new end, and a new train of holy affec-
tions ? Have I set my hopes and heart in heaven 1
And is it not. the scope, and design, and bent of my
heart, to get well to heaven, and see the glorious face
of God, and live in his love and praise ? And when
I sin, is it against the habitual bent and design of my
heart? And do I conquer all gross sins, and am 1
weary and willing to be rid of my infirmities? This
is the state of converted souls. And thus it must be
with me, or I must perish. Is it thus with me indeed,



Doct 1. THE UNCONVERTED. 59

or is it not ? It is time to get this doubt resolved, be-
fore the dreadful Judge resolve it. I am not such a
stranger to my own heart and life, but I may some-
what perceive whether I am thus converted or not : if
I be not, it w r ill do me no good to natter my soul with
false conceits and hopes. I am resolved no more to
deceive myself, but endeavor to know truly whether
I be converted or not : that if I be, I may rejoice in it,
and glorify my gracious Lord, and comfortably go on
till I reach the crown : and if I am not, I may set my-
self to beg and seek after the grace that should con-
vert me, and may turn without any more delay. For,
if I mid in time that I am out of the way, by the help
of Christ I may turn and be recovered ; but if I stay
till either my heart be forsaken of God in blindness or
hardness, or till I be catched away by death, it is then
too late. There is no place for repentance and con-
version then ; I know it must be now or never.

Sirs, this is my request to you, that you will but
*ake your hearts to task, and thus examine them till
you see, if it may be, whether you are converted or
not? And if you cannot find it out by your own en-
deavors, go to your ministers, if they be faithful and
experienced men, and desire their assistance. The
matter is great ; let not bashfulness, nor carelessness
hinder you. They are set over you, to advise you, for
the saving of your soul, as physicians advise you for
the curing of your bodies. It undoes many thousands
that they think they are in the way to salvation when
they are not ; and think that they are converted when
it is no such thing. And then when we call to them
daily to turn, they go away as they came, and think
that this concerns not them ; for they are turned al-
ready, and hope they shall do well enough in the way



60 A CALL TO Doct. I

that they are in, at least if they pick the fairest path,
and avoid some of the foulest steps, when, alas! all
this while they live but to the world and flesh, and
are strangers to God and eternal life ; and are quite
out of the way to heaven. And all this- because we
cannot persuade them to a few serious thoughts of
their condition, and to spend a few hours in the ex-
amining of their states. Are there net many self-
deceivers who hear me this day, that never bestowed
one hour, or quarter of an hour, in all their lives, to
examine their souls, and try whether they are truly
converted or not 7 O merciful God, that will care for
such wretches that care no more for themselves, and
that will do so much to save them from hell, and help
them to heaven, who will do so little for it themselves !
If all that are in the way to hell, and in the state of
damnation, did but know it, they durst not continue
in it. The greatest hope that the devil hath of bring-
ing you to damnation without a rescue, is by keeping
you blindfold, and ignorant of your state, and making
you believe that you may do well enough in the way
that you are in. If you knew that you were out of
the way to heaven, and were lost for ever if you should
die as you are, durst you sleep another night in the
state that you are in ? Durst you live another day in
it ? Could you heartily laugh, or be merry in such a
state ? What ! And not know but you may be snatch-
ed away to hell in an hour? Sure it would constrain
you to forsake your former company and courses, and
to betake yourselves to the ways of holiness and the
communion of saints. Sure it would drive you to cry
to God for a new heart, and to seek help of those that
are fit to counsel you. There are none of you that
care for bein? damned. Well, then I beseech you



Doct- 2. THE UNCONVERTED. 61

presently make inquiry into your hearts, and give
them no rest till you find out your condition, that if it
be good, you may rejoice in it, and go on ; and if it be
bad, you may presentty look about you for recovery,
as men that believe they must turn or die. What say
you, sirs, will you resolve and promise to be at thus
much labor for your own souls ? Will you now enter
upon this self-examination ? Is "ny request unreason-
able ? Your consciences know it is not. Resolve on
it then, before you stir ; knowing how much it con-
cerneth your souls. I beseech you, for the sake of that
God that doth command you, at whose bar you will
all shortly appear, that you do not deny me this rea-
sonable request. For the sake of tiuse souls that must
turn or die, I beseech you deny me not ; but make it
your business to understand your own conditions, and
build upon sure ground, and know whether you are
converted or not ; and venture not your souls on negli-
gent security.

But oerhaps you will say, ' What if we should find
ourselves yet unconverted, what shall we do then V
This question leads me to my second Doctrine, which
Will do much to the answering of it, to which I now
proceed.

DOCTRINE II.

It is the promise of God, that the wicked shall live,
if they will but turn — unfeignedly and thorough-
ly iurn.

The Lord here professeth that this is what he takes
pleasure in, that the wicked turn and live. Heaven
is made as sure to the converted, as hell is to the un-
converted. Turn and live, is as certain a truth as

Bax. CaJ>. et



62 A CALL TO Doct. 2.

turn or die. God was not bound lo provide us a Sa-
vior, nor open to us a door of hope, nor call us to re-
pent and turn, when once we had cast ourselves away
by sin. But he hath freely done it to magnify his
mercy. Sinners, there are none of you shall have
cause to go home, and say 1 preach desperation to
you. Do we use to shut the door of mercy against
you 1 O that you would not shut it up against your-
selves ! Do we use to tell you that God will have no
mercy on you, though you turn and be sanctified ?
When did you ever hear a preacher say such a word ?
You that cavil at the preachers of the Gospel for de-
siring to keep you out of hell, and say, that they
preach desperation ; tell me if you can ; when did }>-ou
ever hear any sober man say, that there is no hope
for you, though you repent, and be converted ? No, it
is the direct contrary that we daily proclaim from the
Lord ; and whoever is born again, and by faith and
repentance doth become a new creature, shall cer-
tainly be saved ; and so far are we from persuading
you to despair of this, that we persuade you not to
make any doubt of it. It is life, not death, that is the
first part of our message to you; our commission is to
offer salvation, certain salvation ; a speedy, glorious,
everlasting salvation, to every one of you ; to the poor-
est beggar as well as the greatest lord; to the worst
of you, even to drunkards, swearers, worldlings, thieves,
yea, to the despisers and reproachers of the holy way
of salvation. We are commanded by the Lord our
Master to offer you a pardon for all that is past, if you
will but now at last return and live ; we are com-
manded to beseech and entreat you to accept the offer,
and return ; to tell you what preparation is made by
Christ; what mercy stays for you; what patience



Doct. 2. THE UNCONVERTED. 05

waketh for you ; what thoughts of kindness God hath
toward you ; and how happy, how certainly and un-
speakably happy you may be if you will. We have
indeed also a message of wrath and death, yea, of a
twofold wrath and death ; but neither of them is our
principal message. We must tell you of the wrath
that is on you already, and the death that you are
horn under, for the breach of the law of works ; but
this is but to show you the need of mercy, and to
provoke you to esteem the grace of the Redeemer.
And we tell you nothing but the truth, which you
must know ; for who will seek for physic that knows
not that he is sick ? Our telling you of your misery-
is not that which makes you miserable, but driveth
you out to seek for mercy. It is you that have brought
ihis death upon yourselves. We tell you also of an-
other death, even remediless, and much greater tor-
ment, that will fall on those that will not be converted.
But as this is true, and must be told you, so it is but
the last and saddest part of our message. We are
first to offer you mercy, if you will turn ; and it is only
those that will not turn, nor hear the voice of mercy,
to whom we must foretell damnation. Will you but
cast away your transgressions, delay no longer, but
come away at the call of Christ, and be converted,
and become new creatures, and we have not a word
of damning wrath or death to speak against you. I
do here, in the name of the Lord of Life, proclaim to
you all that hear me this day, to the worst of you, to
the greatest, to the oldest sinner, that you may have
mercy and salvation, if you will but turn. There is
mercy in God, there is sufficiency in the satisfaction
of Christ, the promise is free, and full, and universal ;
you may have life, if you will but turn. But then,



04 A CALL TO Doct. 2.

as you love your souls, remember what turning it is
that the Scripture speaks of. It is not to mend the old
house, but to pull down all, and build anew on Christ,
the Rock, and sure foundation. It is not to mend
somewhat in a carnal course of life, but to- mortify the
flesh, and live after the Spirit. It is not to serve the
flesh and the world, in a more reformed way, without
any scandalous disgraceful sins, and with a certain
kind of religiousness ; but it is to change your master,
and your works, and end ; and to set your face the
contrary way, and do all for the life that you never
saw, and dedicate yourselves and all you have to
God. This is the change that must be made, if ycu
will live.

Yourselves are witnesses now, that it is salvation,
and not damnation, that is the great doctrine I preach
to you, and the first part of my message to you. Ac-
cept of this, and we shall go no farther with you;
for we would not so much as affright, or trouble you
with the name of damnation, without necessity.

But if you will not be saved, there is no remedy,
but damnation must take place ; for there is no middle
place between the two ; you must have ei Jier life or
death.

And we are not only to offer you life, but to shrw
you the grounds on which we do it, und call you to
believe that God doth mean, indeed, as he speaks;
that the promise is true, and extended conditionally
to you, as well as others ; and that heaven ib no fancy,
but a true felicity.

If you ask, Where is your commission for this offer?
Among a hundred texts of Scripture, I will show it to
you in these few :

First, You see it here in my text, and the following



Doct. 2. THE UNCONVERTED. G5

verses, and in the 18th of Ezekiel, as plain as can be
spuken; and hi 2 Cor. 5 : 17, 21, you have the very-
sum of our commission : " If any man be in Christ, he
is a new creature : old things are passed away ; be-
hold, all tilings are become new. And all things are
of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus
Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconci-
liation ; to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the
world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses to
them, and hath committed unto us the word of recon-
ciliation. Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ,
as though God did beseech you by us : we pray you
in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled unto God. For he
hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin ; that
we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
So Mark, 16 : 15, 16, " Go ye into all the world, and
preach the Gospel to every creature. He that be-
lieveth," (that is with such a converting faith as is ex-
pressed,) " and is baptized, shall be saved ; and he
that believe th not, shall be damned." And Luke,
24 : 46, 47 : " Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and
to rise from the dead the tlnrd day : and that repen-
tance" (which is conversion) " and remission of sins
should be preached in his name among ail nations."
And, Acts 5 : 30, 31, " The God of our fathers raised
up Jesus, whom ye slew, and hanged on a tree : him
hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince
and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and for-
giveness of sins." And Acts, 13 : 38, 39, " Be it known
unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that through
this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins ;
and by him all that believe are justified from all
things, from which ye could not be justified by the
law of Moses." And lest you think this offer is re-



66 A CALL TO Doct. 2.

strained to the Jews, see Gal. 6 : 15, " For in Christ
Jesus, neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor un-
circumcision, but a new creature." And Luke, 14 : 17,
" Come, for all things are now ready."

You see by this time that we are commanded to
offer life to you all, and to tell you from God, that if
you will turn, you may live.

Here you may safely tmst your souls ; for the love
of God is the foundation of this offer, (John, 3 : 16,) and
the blood of the Son of God hath purchased it j the
faithfulness and truth of God is engaged to make the
promise good ; miracles oft sealed the truth of it ;
preachers are sent through the world to proclaim it ;
and the Spirit doth open the heart to entertain it, and
is itself the earnest of the full possession : so that the
truth of it is past controversy, that the worst of you
all, and every one of you, if you will but be converted,
may be saved.

Indeed, if you will believe that you shall be saved
without conversion, then you believe a falsehood ; and
if I should preach that to you, I should preach a lie.
This were not to believe God, but the devil and your
own deceitful hearts. God hath his promise of life,
and the devil hath his promise of life. God's promise
is, Return and live. The devil's promise is, You shall
live whether you turn or not. The words of God are,
as I have showed you, " Except ye be converted and
become as little children, ye cannot enter into the
kingdom of heaven." Matt. 18 : 3. " Except a man
be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom ol
God." John, 3 : 3, 5. " Without holiness no man shall
see the Lord." Heb. 12 : 14. The devil's word is,
" You may be saved without being born again and
converted j you may do well enough without being



Doct- 2. THE UNCONVERTED. 67

holy, God doth bat frighten you : he is more merciful
than to do as he saith, he will be better to you than
his word." And, alas, the greatest part of the world
believe this word of the devil before the word of God;
just as our sin and misery came into the world. God
said to our first parents, " If ye eat ye shall die ;" and
die devil contradicted him, and said, " Ye shall not
die:-' and the woman believed the devil before God.
So now the Lord saith, Turn or die : and the devil
saiih, You shall not die, if you do but cry for God's
mercy at last, and give over the acts of sin when you
can practise it no longer. And this is the word that
the world believes. O heinous wickedness, to believe
the 'J evil before God.

And yet that is not the worst ; but blasphemously
they call this a believing and trusting in God, when
they put him in the shape of satan, who was a liar
from the beginning ; and when they believe that the
word of God is a lie, they call this a ti listing God, and
say they believe in him, and trust in him for salva-
tion. Where did ever God say, that tie unregenerate,
unconverted, unsanctified, shall be ss ved ? Show me
such a word in Scripture. Why this is the devil's
word, and to believe it is to believe the devil, and the
sin that is commonly called presumption ; and do you
call this a believing and trusting in God? There is
enough in the word of God tc comfort and strengthen
the heart of the sanctified, bu not a word to strengthen
the hands of wickedness, nor to give men the least hope
of being saved though they be never sanctified.

But if you will turn, and come into the way of
mercy, the mercy of the Lord is ready to entertain
you. Then trust God for salvation, boldly and confi-
dently ; for he is engaged by his word to save you.



bO A CALL TO Dact. 3

He will be a father to none but his children; and he
wiil save none but those that forsake the world, the
devil, and the flesh, and come into his family to be
members of his Son, and have communion with his
saints.. But if they will not come in, it is the iauU
of themselves : his doors are open ; he keeps none back ;
he never sent such a message as this to any of you,
" It is now too late ; I will not receive thee, though
thou be converted." He might have done so and done
you no wrong ; but he did not ; he doth not to this day.
He is still ready to receive you, if you were but ready
unfeignedly, and with all your hearts, to turn. And
the fulness of this truth will yet more appear in the
two following doctrines, which I sha.ll therefore next
proceed to before I make any further application of
this.

DOCTRINE III.

God laketh pleasure in men's conversion and sal-
vation, but not in their death or damnation He
had rather they woidd turn and live, than go on
and die.

£C The Lord is long suffering to us-ward," says the:
apostle, :i not willing that any should perish, but tha«
all should come to repentance," 2 Pet. 3 : 9. He un
feignedly willeth the conversion of all men, even o<
those that never will be converted, but not as absolute
Lord with the fullest efficacious resolution, nor as a
thing which he resolveth shall undoubtedly come to
pass, or would engage all his power to accomplish. I*
is in the power of a prince to set a guard upon a mur-
derer, to see that he shall not murder, and be hanged ;
but if, upon good reason, he forbear this, and do but



Ooct. 3- THE UNCONVERTED. 09

send to his subjects to warn and entreat them not to
be murderers, he may well say that he would not hava
them murder and be hanged ; he takes no pleasure in
it, but rather that they forbear and live, and if he do
more for some upon some special reason, he is not
bound to do so by all. The king may well say to all
murderers and felons in the land, " I have no pleasure
in your death, but rather that you would obey my
laws and live; but if you will not, I am resolved, for
all tins, that you shall die." The judge may truly
say to the murderer, " Alas, I have no delight in thy
death ; I had rather thou hadst kept the law and saved
thy life; but seeing thou hast not, I must condemn
thee, or else I should be unjust." So, though God have
no pleasure in your damnation, and therefore calls
upon you to return and live, yet he hath pleasure in
the demonstration of his own justice, and the execut-
ing of his laws ; and therefore he is, for all this, fully
resolved, that if you will not be converted, you shall
be condemned. If God was so much against the
death of the wicked as that he were resolved to do
all that he can to hinder it, then no man should be
condemned ; whereas Christ telleth you, that " nar-
row is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there
be that find it." But so far God is opposed to your
damnation as that he will teach you, and warn you,
and set before you life and death, and offer you your
choice, and command his ministers to entreat you not
to destroy yourselves, but accept his mercy, and so to
leave you without excuse. But if this will not do,
and if still you be unconverted, he professeth to yon,
he is resolved on your damnation, and hath com-
manded us to say to you in his name, verse 8, " O
wicked man thou shalt surely die !" And Christ hath



70 A CALL TO Doct. S

little less than sworn it, over and over, with a " verily,
verily, except ye be converted and born again, ye
cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven." Matt.
18 : 3. John, 3 : 3. Mark, that he saith, " you can
not." It is in vain to hope for it, and in vain to dream
that God is willing for it ; for it is a thing that can-
not be.

In a word, you see then the meaning of the text,
that God, the great Lawgiver of the world, doth take
no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that
they turn and live ; though yet he be resolved that
none shall live but those that turn ; and as a judge,
even delighteth in justice, and in manifesting his
hatred of sin, though not in the misery which sinners
have brought upon themselves, in itself considered.

And for the proofs of the point, I shall be very
brief in them, because I suppose you easily believe it
already.

1. The very gracious nature of God proclaimed -
" And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaim-
ed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, anc*.
transgression, and sin, and that will by no means
clear the guilty;" (Exod. 34 : 6, 7;) and frequently
elsewhere, may assure you of this, That he hath no
pleasure in your death.

2. IT God had more pleasure in thy death, than in
thy conversion and life, he would not have so fre-
quently commanded thee in his word, to turn; he
would not have made thee such promises of life, it
tkou wilt but turn : he would not have persuaded thee
to it by so many reasons. The tenor of his Gospel
proveth the point.

'.]. And his commission that he hath given to the
ministers of the Gospel doth fully prove it. If God
had taken more pleasure in thy damnation, than in
iby conversion and salvation, he would never have
charged us to cfter you mercy, and to teach you the
way of life, both publicly and privately: and to en-
tieat and beseech you to turn and live ; to acquaint
you with your sins, and foretell you of your danger ;
and to do all that possibly w T e can for your conversion,
and to continue patiently so doing, though you should
hate or abuse us for our pains. Would God have done
this, and appointed his ordinances for your good, if he
had taken pleasure in your death ?

4. It is proved also by the course of his providence.
If God had rather you were damned than converted
and saved, he would not second his word with his
works, and entice you by his daily kindness to himself,
and give you all the mercies of this life, which are
means " to lead you to repentance," (Rom. 2 : 4,) and
bring you so often under his rod, to lead you to your
senses ; he would not set so many examples before
your eyes, no, nor wait on you so patiently as he does
from day to day, and year to year. These are not
dgns of one that taketh pleasure in your death. If
his had been his delight, how easily could he have
lad thee long ago in hell ? How oft, before this, could
le have catched thee away in the midst of thy sins
tvith a curse or oath, or lie in thy mouth, in thy igno-
rance, and pride, and sensuality? When thou wert
last in thy drunkenness, or last deriding the ways of
God, how easily could he have stopped thy breath,
and tamed thee with plagues, and made thee sober
in another world ! Alas ! how small a matter is it for
the Almighty to rule the tongue of the profanest railer.

and tie the hands of the most malicious persecutor, or
calm the fury of the bitterest of his enemies, and make
them know that they are but worms ? If he should
but frown upon thee thou wouldst drop into thy grave
If he gave commission to one of his angels to go an
destroy ten thousand sinners, how quickly would it be
done ! how easily can he lay thee upon the bed o
languishing, and make thee lie roaring there in pain,
and make thee eat the words of reproach which thou
hast spoken against his servants, his word, his wor
ship, and his holy ways, and make thee send to beg
their prayers whom thou didst despise in thy presump-
tion ? How easily can he lay that flesh under pains,
and groans, and make it too weak to hold thy soul
and make it more loathsome than the dung of the
earth ? That flesh which now must have what it
loves, and must not be displeased, though God be dis-
pleased j and must be humored in meat, and drink,
and clothes, whatever God say to the contrary, how
quickly would the frowns of God consume it? When
thou wast passionately defending thy sin, and quar-
relling with them that would have drawn thee from *
it, and showing thy spleen against the reprover, and
pleading for the works of darkness ; how easily could
God have snatched thee away in a moment, and set
thee before his dreadful Majesty, where thou shouldst
see ten thousand times ten thousand glorious angels
waiting on his throne, and have called thee there to
plead thy cause, and asked thee " What hast thou
now to say against thy Creator, his truth, his servants,
or his holy ways ? Now plead thy cause, and make
the best of it thou canst. Now what canst thou say
in excuse of thy sins ? Now give account of thy world
liness and fleshly life, of thy time, of all the mercies



Doct. 3. THE UNCONVERTED. 73

thou hast had." O how thy stubborn heart would
have melted, and thy proud looks be taken down, and
thy countenance be appalled, and thy stout words
turned into speechless silence, or dreadful cries, if God
had but set thee thus at his bar, and pleaded his own
cause with thee, which thou hast here so maliciously
plended against ! How easily can he at any time say
to thy guilty soul, Come away, and live in that flesh
no more till the resurrection, and it cannot resist ! A
word of his mouth would lake off the poise of thy pre-
sent life, and then all thy parts and powers would
stand still ; and if he say unto thee, Live no longer, or,
live in hell, thou couldst not disobey.

But God hath yet done none of this, but hath pa-
tiently forborne thee, and mercifully upheld thee, and
given thee that breath which thou didst breathe out
against hi in, and given those mercies which thou
didst sacrifice to thy flesh, and afforded thee that pro-
vision which thou didst use to satisfy thy greedy
throat: he gave thee every minute of that time which
thou didst waste in idleness, or drunkenness, or w r orld-
iiness ; and doth not all his patience and mercy show
that he desired not thy damnation 1 Can the candle
burn without the oil ? Can your houses stand without
the earth to bear them ? No more can you live an
h&ui without the support of God. And why did he,
so long support thy life, but to see when thou wouldst
bethink thee of the folly of thy ways, and return and
live ? Will any man purposely put arms into his ene-
my's hands to resist him, or hold a candle to a mur-
derer that is killing his children, or to an idle servant
that plays or sleeps the while ? Surely it is to see
whether thou wilt at last return and live, that God
hath so long waited on thee.

5. It is further Droved by the suffering of his Son.
that God taketh no pleasure in the death of the wicked.
Would he have ransomed them from death at so dear
a rate ? Would he have astonished angels and men
by his condescension ? Would God have dwelt in
flesh, and have come in the form of a servant, and
have assumed humanity into one person with the God •
head; and would Christ have lived a life of suffering,
and died a cursed death for sinners, if he had rather
taken pleasure in their death ? Suppose you saw him
but so busy in preaching and healing of them, as you
find him in Mark, 3 : 21 j or so long in fasting, as in
Matt. 4 ; or all night in prayer, as in Luke 6 : 12 ; or
praying with the drops of blood trickling from him
instead of sweat, as Luke 22 : 44 ; or suffering a cursed
death upon the cross, and pouring out his soul as a sa-
crifice for our sins — would you have thought these the
signs of one that delighted in the death of the wicked ?

And think not to extenuate it by saying, that it
was only for his elect : for it was thy sin, and the sin
of all the world, that lay upon our Redeemer ; and hia
sacrifice and satisfaction is sufficient for all, and the
fruits of it are offered to one as well as another. But it
is true, that it was never the intent of his mind to par-
don and save any that would not, by faith and repen-
tance, be converted. If you had seen and heard him
weeping and bemoaning the state of disobedience in
impenitent people : (Luke, 19 * 41, 42,) " And when
he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over
it, saying, if thou hadst known, even thou, at least in
this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace !
but now they are hid from thine eyes" — or complain-
ing of their stubbornness, as Matt. 23 : 37, " O Jeru-
salem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered



Doct. 4. THE UNCONVERTED. 75

thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
chickens under her wings, and ye would not P* or
if you had seen and heard him on the cross, praying
for his persecutors — Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do — would you have suspected
that he had delighted in the death of the wicked, even
of those that perish by their wilful unbelief ? When
God hath so loved, (not only loved, but so loved.) aa
to give his only begotten Son, that whosoever believ-
eth in him (by an effectual faith) should not perish,
but have everlasting life, I think he hath hereby
nroved, against the malice of men and devils, that he
takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but had
rather that they would " turn and live."

6. Lastly, If all this will not yet satisfy you, take
His own word that knoweth best his own mind, or at
least believe his oath : but this leads me to the fourth
doctrine.

DOCTRINE IV.

The Lord hath confirmed to us by his Oath, that he

hath no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but

rather that he turn and live; that he may leave

man no pretence to question the truth of it.

If you dare question his word, I hope you dare not

question his oath. As Christ hath solemnly protested

that the unregenerate and unconverted cannot enter

into the kingdom of heaven ; (Matt. 18 : 3 ; John,

3 : 3 ;) so God hath sworn that his pleasure is not in

their death, but in their conversion and life. And as

the aposde saith, (Heb. 4 : 13, 18,) because he can

ewear by no greater, he sware by himself. " For men

verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirma-



76 A CALL TO D"*- «•

♦ion is to them an end of strife. Wherein God, will-
ing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of pro-
mise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by
an oath ; that by two immutable things in which it
was impossible for God to lie, we might .have strong
consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on
the hope set before us : which hope we have as an
anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast." If there
be any man that cannot reconcile this truth with the
doctrine of predestination, or the actual damnation of
the wicked, that is his own ignorance ; he hath no
pretence left to question or deny therefore the truth of
the point in hand ; for this is confirmed by the oath
of God, and therefore must not be distorted, to reduce
it to other points : but doubtful points must rather be
reduced to it, and certain truths must be believed to
agree with it, though our shallow minds hardly dis-
cern the agreement.

Use. — I do now entreat thee, if thou be an uncon-
verted sinner that nearest these words, that thou
wouldst ponder a little upon the forementioned doc-
trines, and bethink thyself awhile who it is that takes
pleasure in thy sin and damnation. Certainly it is
not God ; he hath sworn for his part that he takes no
pleasure in it. And I know it is not the pleasing of
him that you intend. You dare not say that you
drink, and swear, and neglect holy duties, and quench
the motions of the Spirit to please God. That were
as if you should reproach the prince, and break his
laws, and seek his death, and say you did all this to
please him.

Who is it then that takes pleasure in your sin and
death 1 Not any that bear the image of God, for they



Doet 4. THE UNCONVERTED. 7?

must be like minded to him. God knows, it is small
pleasure to your faithful teachers to see you serve
your deadly enemy, and madly venture your eternal
state, and wilfully run into the flames of hell. It is
small pleasure to them to see upon your souls (in the
ead effects) such blindness, and hard-heartedness, and
carelessness, and presumption ; such wilfulness in evil,
and such unteachableness and stiffness against the
ways of life and peace ; they know these are marks
of death, and of the wrath of God, and they know,
from the word of God, what is like to be the end of
them, and therefore it is no more pleasure to them
than to a tender physician to see the plague-marks
broke out upon his patient. Alas, to foresee your ever-
lasting torments, and know not how to prevent them !
To see how near you are to hell, and we cannot make
you believe it and consider it. To see how easily,
how certainly you might escape, if we knew but how
to make you willing. How fair you are for everlast-
ing salvation, if you would turn and do your best, and
make it the care and business of your lives ! but you
will not do it; if our lives lay on it, we cannot per-
suade you to it. We study day and night what to
say to you that may convince and persuade you, and
yet it is undone : we lay before you the word of God.
and show you the very chapter and verse where it is
written, that you cannot be saved except you be con-
verted ; and yet we leave the most of you as we find
you. We hope you will believe the word of God,
though you believe not us, and regard it when we
show you the plain Scripture for it ; but we hope in-
vain, and labor in vain as to any saving change upon
your hearts ! And do you think that this is a pleasant
thing to us ? Many a time, in secret prayer, we are

fain to complain to God with pad heart!?, " Alas, Lord,
wc have spoken to them in thy name, but they little
regard us ; we have told them what thou bidst us tell
them concerning the danger of an unconverted state.
but they do not believe us: wc have told them that
thou hast protested that there is no peace to the
wicked ;" (Isa. 57 : 21 ;) " but the worst of them all
will scarcely believe that they are wicked. We
have showed them thy word, where thou hast said,
that if they live after the flesh they shall die ;" (Rom.
8 : 13,) " but they say, they will believe in thee, when
they will not believe thee ; and that they will trust in
thee, when they give no credit to thy word ; and when
they lupe that the threatenings of thy word arc false,
they will yet call this a hoping in God ; and though
we show them where thou hast said, that when a
wicked man dieth, all his hopes perish, yet cannot we
persuade them from their deceitful hopes." Prov,
11:7. " We fell them what a base unprofitable
thing sin is ; but they love it, and therefore will not
leave it. We tell them how dear they buy this plea-
sure, and what they must pay for it in everlasting
torment; and they bless themselves, and will not be-
lieve it, but will do as the most do ; and because God
is merciful, they will not believe him, but will ven-
ture their souls, come what will. We tell them hew
ready the Lord is to receive them, and this doth but
make them delay their repentance and be bolder in
their sin. Some of them say they purpose to repent,
but they are still the same ; and some say they do re-
pent already, while yet tfcey are not converted from
their sins. We exhort them, we entreat them, w<3
offer them our help, but we cannot prevail vyith them;
but they that were drunkards, are drunkards still ; and



Ooct. 4. THE UNCONVERTED. 79

they that were voluptuous flesh-pleasing wretches, are
such still ; and they that were worldlings, are world-
lings still ; and they that were ignorant, and proud,
and self-conceited, are so still. Few of them will see
and confess their sin, and fewer will forsake it, but
comfort themselves that all men are sinners, as if there
were no difference between a converted sinner and an
unconverted. Some of them will not come near us,
when we are willing to instruct them, but think they
know enough already, and need not. our instruction ;
and some of them will give us the hearing, and do
what they list ; and most of them are like dead men
that cannot feel ; so that when we tell them of the
matters of everlasting consequence, we cannot get a
word of it to their hearts. If we do not obey them,
and humor them in doing all that they would have
us, though never so much against the word of God,
they will hate us, and rail at us ; but if we beseech
them to confess, and forsake their sins, and save their
souls, they will not do it. They would have us dis-
obey God and damn our own souls, to please them ;
and yet they will not torn and save their own souls
to please God. They are wiser in their own eyes than
all their teachers ; they rage and are confident in their
own way, and if w T e are ever so anxious we cannot
change them. Lord, this is the case of our miserable
neighbors, and we cannot help it ; we see them ready
to drop into hell, and we cannot help it : we know if
they would unfeignedly turn, they might be saved,
but we cannot persuade them ; if we would beg it of
them on our knees, we cannot persuade them to it ; if
we would beg it of them with tears., we cannot per-
suade them ; and what more can we do?
These are the secret complaints and moans that



60 A CALL TO Doct. 4.

many a poor minister is compelled to make. And do
you think that he hath any pleasure in this? Is it a
pleasure to him to see you go on in sin, and cannot
stop you? to see you so miserable, and cannot so
much as make you sensible of it? to see you merry
when you are not sure to be an hour out of hell ? to
think what you must for ever suffer, because you will
not turn? and to think what an everlasting life of
glory you wilfully despise and cast away? What
sadder tiling can you bring to their hearts, and how
can you devise to grieve them more ?

Who is it then that you please by your sin and
death? It is none of your understanding godly friends.
Alas, it is the grief of their souls to see your misery,
and they lament you many a time when you give
them little thanks for it, and when you have not
hearts to lament yourselves.

Who is it then that takes pleasure in your sin ?

1. The devil indeed takes pleasure in your sin and
death ; for this is the very end of all his temptations ;
for this he watches night and day ; you cannot devise
to please him better than to go on in sin. How glad
is he when he sees thee going into the alehouse, or
other sin, and when he heareth thee curse, or swear,
or rail ? How glad is he when he heareth thee revile
the minister that would draw thee from thy sin, and
help to save thee? These are his delight.

2. The wicked are also delighted in it ; for it ia
agreeable to their nature.

3. But I know, for all this, that it is not the pleas-
ing of the devil that you intend, even when you please
him ; but it is your own flesh, the greatest and most
dangerous enemy, that you intend to please. It is the-
flesh that would be pampered, that would be pleased



Doet. 4. THE UNCONVERTED. 81

in meat, and drink, and clothing ; that would be pleased
in your company, and pleased in applause and credit
with the world, and pleased in sports, and lusts, and
idleness; this is the gulf that devoureth all. This is
the very god that you serve, for the Scripture saith
of such, that their bellies are their gods. Phil. 3 : 19.
But I beseech you stay a little and consider the bu-



1. Question. Should your flesh be pleased before
your maker ? Will you displease the Lord, and dis-
please your teacher, and your godly friends, and aU
to please your brutish appetites, or sensual desires'?
Is not God worthy to be the ruler of your flesh ? If he
shall not rale it, he will not save it ; you cannot in
reason expect that he should.

2. Question. Your flesh is pleased with your sin,
but is your conscience pleased ? Doth not it grudge
within you, and tell you sometimes that all is not well,
and that your case is not so safe as you make it to be ;
and should not your souls and consciences be pleased
before your corruptible flesh?

3. Question. But is not your flesh preparing for its
own displeasure also ? It loves the bait, but doth it
love the hook 1 It loves the strong drink and sweet
morsels ; it loves its ease, and sports, and merriment ;
it loves to be rich, and well spoken of by men, and to
be somebody in the world ; but doth it love the curse
of God? Doth it love to stand trembling before his
bar, and to be judged to everlasting fire? Doth it
love to be tormented with the devils for ever ? Take
all together ; for there is no separating sin and hell,
but only by faith and true conversion ; if you will keep
one, you must have the other. If death and hell be
pleasant to thee, no wonder then if you go on in sin •



82 A CALL TO Doct 3

but if they be not, (as I am sure they are not,) then
what if sin were never so pleasant, is it worth the loss
of life eternal? Is a little drink, or meat, or ease; is
the good word of sinners, is the riches of this world to
be valued above the joys of heaven ? Or are they
worth the sufferings of eternal fire ? Sirs, these ques-
tions should be considered before you go any further,
by every man that hath reason to consider, and that
believes he hath a soul to save or lose.

Well, the Lord here sweareth that he hath no plea-
sure in your death, but rather that you would turn
and live ; if yet you will go on and die rather than
turn, remember it was not to please God that you did
it : it was to please the world, and to please your-
selves. And if men will damn themselves to please
themselves, and run into endless torments for delight,
and have not the wit, the hearts, the grace, to hearken
to God or man that would reclaim them, what remedy
is there, but they must take what they get by it, and
repent it in another manner, when it is too late ? Be-
fore I proceed any further in the application I shall
come to the next doctrine, which gives me a fuller
ground for it.

DOCTRINE V.

So earnest is God for the conversion of sinners that
he doubleth his commands and exhortations, with
vehemency — Turn ye, turn ye, why will you die ?
This doctrine is the application of the former, as
by a use of exhortation, and accordingly I shall han-
dle it. Is there an unconverted sinner that heareth
these vehement words of God ? Is there a man or
woman in this assembly that is yet a stranger to the



Doct. 5 THE UNCONVERTED. 83

renewing sanctifying work of the Holy Ghost ? It is
a happy assembly, if it be not so with the most.
Hearken then to the voice of your Maker, and turn to
liim by Christ without delay. Would you know the
will of God 1 Why this is his will, that you presently
turn. Shall the living God send so earnest a message
to his creatures, and should they not obey ?

Hearken then, all you that live after the flesh : the
Lord that gave thee thy breath and being hath sent
a message to thee from heaven ; and this is his mes-
sage, Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die? He that
hath ears to hear, let him hear. Shall the voice of
the eternal Majesty be neglected? If he do but ter-
ribly thunder, thou art afraid. O but this voice doth
more nearly concern thee. If he did but tell thee thou
shalt die to-morrow, thou wouldst not make light of
it. O but this word concerneth thy life or death ever-
lasting. It is both a command and an exhortation.
As if he had said to thee, " I charge thee, upon the
allegiance that thou owest to me thy Creator and
Redeemer, that thou renounce the flesh, the world,
and the devil, and turn to me, that thou mayest live.
I condescend to entreat thee, as thou either lovest or
fearest him that made thee ; as thou lovest thine own
life, even thine everlasting life, turn and live : as ever
thou wouldst escape eternal misery, turn, turn, for
why wilt thou die?" And is there a heart in man,
in a reasonable creature, that can once refuse such a
message, such a command, such an exhortation as
tins 1 O what a thing, then, is the heart of man !

Hearken, then, all that love yourselves, and all that
regard your own salvation ; here is the most joyful
message that was ever sent to the ears of man,
u Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die? v You are not



84 A CALL TO Doct. fc

yet shut up under desperation. Here is mercy offered
you ; turn, and you shall have it. O Sirs ! with what
glad and joyful hearts should you receive these tid-
ings ! I know this is not the first time that you have
heard it; but how have you regarded it, or how do
you regard it now? Hear, all you ignorant, careless
sinners, the word of the Lord. Hear, all you world-
lings, you sensual flesh-pie asers; you gluttons, and
drunkards, and whoremongers, and swearers; you
railers and backbiters, slanderers and liars — Tarn ye,
turn ye, -why will ye die ?

Hear, all you cold and outside professors, and all
that are strangers to the life of Christ, and never knew
the power of his cross and resurrection, and never felt
your hearts warmed with his love, and live not on
him as the strength of your souls — " Turn ye, turn ye,
why will ye die '?"

Hear, all that are void of the love of God, whose
hearts are not toward him, nor taken up with the
hopes of glory, but set more by your earthly prospe-
rity and delights than by the joys of heaven ; all you
that are religious but a little-by-the-by, and give God
no more than your flesh can spare ; that have not de-
nied your carnal selves, and forsaken all that you have
for Christ, m the estimation and grounded resolution
of your souls, but have some one thing in the world
bo dear to you that you cannot spare it for Christ, if
he required it, but will rather venture on his displea-
sure than forsake it — " Turn ye, turn ye, why will
ye die?"

If you never heard it, or observed it. before, remem-
ber that you were told from the word of God this (Jay,
that if you will but turn, you may live ; and if you
will not turn, you shall surely die.



Doct. 5. THE UNCONVERTED. 86

What now will you do, sirs ? What is your reso-
iution? Will you turn, or will you not? Halt not
any longer between two opinions. If the Lord be
God, fellow him : if your flesh be God, then serve it
still. If heaven be better than earth and fleshly plea-
sures, come away, then, and seek a better country,
and lay up your treasure where rust and moths do
not corrupt, and thieves cannot break through and
steal; and be awakened at last, with all your might,
to seek the kingdom that cannot be moved, (Heb.
12 : 28,) and to employ your lives on a higher design,
and turn the stream of your cares and labors another
way than formerly you have done. But if earth be
better than heaven, or will do more for you, or last
you longer, then keep it, and make your best of it, and
follow it still. Sirs, are you resolved what to do ? If
you be not, I will set a few more moving considera-
lons before you, to see if reason will make you resolve.

Consider, I. What preparations mercy hath made
for your salvation; and w T hat pity it is that any man
ehoald be damned after all this. The time was, when
the flaming sword w T as in the way, and the curse of
God's law would have kept thee back if thou hadst
been never so willing to turn to God. The time was,
when thyself, and all the friends that thou hast in the
world, could never have produced thee the pardon of
thy sins past, though thou hadst never so much la-
mented and reformed them. But Christ hath removed
this impediment, by the ransom of his blood. The
time was, that God was wmolly unreconciled, as be-
ing not satisfied for the violation of his law ; but now
he is so far satisfied and reconciled, as that he hath
made thee a free act of oblivion, and a free deed of
gift of Christ and life, and ofiereth it to thee, and en-

treateth thee to accept it ; and it may be thine, if thou
wilt. For, " he was in Christ reconciling the world
to himself, and hath committed to us the word of re-
conciliation." 2 Cor. 5 : 18, 19. Sinners, we too are
commanded to deliver this message to you all, as from
the Lord ; " Come, for all things are ready." Luke,
14 : 17. Are all things ready, and are you unready ?
God is ready to entertain you, and pardon all that
you have done against him, if you will but come. As
long as you have sinned, as wilfully as you have sin-
ned, he is ready to cast all behind his back, if you
will but come. Though you have been prodigals,
and run away from God, and have staid so long, be
is ready even to meet you, and embrace you in his
arms, and rejoice in your conversion, if you will but
turn. Even the worldlings and drunkards will find
God ready to bid them welcome, if they will but come.
Doth not this turn thy heart within thee ? O sinner !
if thou hast a heart of flesh, and not of stone in thee,
methinks this should melt it. Shall the dreadful in-
finite Majesty of heaven even wait for thy returning,
and be ready to receive thee, who hast abused him,
and forgotten him so long ? Shall he delight in thy
conversion, that might at any time glorify his justice
in thy damnation ? and yet doth it not melt thy heart
within thee, and art thou not yet ready to come in ?
Hast thou not as much reason to be ready to come as
God hath to invite thee and bid thee welcome ?

But that is not all : Christ hath died on the cross,
and made such way for thee to the Father, that, on
his account, thou mayest be welcome, if thou wilt
come. And yet art thou not ready ?

A pardon is already expressly granted, and offered
thee in the Gospel. And yet art thou not ready ?



Doct 5. THE UNCONVERTED. 87

The ministers of the Gospel are ready to assist thee,
to instruct thee, pray for thee. And yet art thou not
ready ?

All that fear God about thee are ready to rejoice
in thy conversion, and to receive thee into the com-
munion of saints, and to give thee the right hand of
fellowship, yea, though thou hadst been one that had
been cast out of their society : they dare not but forgive
where God forgiveth, when it is manifest to them, by
thy confession and amendment. ; they dare not so much
as reproach thee with thy former sins, because they
know that God will not upbraid thee with them. If
thou hadst been never so scandalous, if thou wouldst
but heartily be converted and come in, they would
not refuse thee, let the world say what they would
against it. And are all these ready to receive thee,
and yet art thou not ready to come in ?

Yea, heaven itself is ready : The Lord will receive
thee into the glory of his saints. Vile as thou hast
been, if thou wilt be but cleansed thou mayest have
a place before his throne ; his angels will be ready to
guard thy soul to the place of joy if thou do but un-
feignedly come in. And is God ready, the sacrifice
of Christ ready, the promise ready, and pardon ready ?
are ministers ready, and the people of God ready, and
heaven itself ready ? and angels ready ? and all these
but waiting for thy conversion ; and yet art thou not
ready ? What ! not ready to live, when thou hast
been dead so long ? not ready to come to thy right
understanding, as the prodigal is said 10 " come to
himself," (Luke, 15 : 17,) when thou has! been beside
thyself so long ? Not ready to be saved, when thou
art even ready to be condemned ? Art thou not ready
to lay hold on Christ, that would deliver thee, when



88 A CALL TO Doct. S

thou art even ready to sink into damnation ? Art thou
not ready to be drawn from hell, when thou art even
ready to be cast remediless into it ? Alas, man ! dost
thou know what thou doest 1 If thou die unconverted
there is no doubt to be made of thy damnation ; and
thou art not sure to live an hour. And yet art thou
not leady to turn and to come in? O miserable
wretch ! Hast thou not served the flesh and the devil
.ong enough? Yet hast thou not enough of sin? I3
:t so good to thee, or so profitable for thee ? Dost thou
know what it is, that thou wouldst yet have more of
it ? Hast thou had so many calls, and so many mer-
cies, and so many warnings, and so many examples?
Hast thou seen so many laid in the grave, and yet
art thou not ready to let go thy sins, and come to
Christ ? What ! after so many convictions and pangg
of conscience, after so many purposes and promises,
art thou not yet ready to turn and live ? O that thy
eyes, thy heart, were opened to know how fair an offer
is now made to thee ! and what a joyful message it is
that we are sent on, to bid thee come, for all thinga
are ready !

II. Consider also, what calls thou hast to turn and
live. How many, how loud, how earnest, how dread-
ful : and yet what encouraging, joyful calls ! For the
principal inviter is God himself. He that command-
eth heaven and earth, commands thee to turn, and
that presently, without delay. He commands the
sun to run its course, and to rise upon thee every
morning; and though it be so glorious an orb, and
many times bigger than all the earth, yet it obeyeth
him, and faileth not one minute of its appointed time.
He commandeth all the planets, and the orbs of hea-
ven, and they obey. He commandeth the sea to ebb



Doct 5. THE UNCONVERTED. 89

and flow, and the whole creation to keep its course,
and all obey him ; the angels of heaven obey his will,
when he sends them to minister to such worms as we
on earth, (Heb. 1 : 14;) and yet if he command but
a sinner to turn, he will not obey him. He only thinks
himself wiser than God, and he cavils and pleads the
cause of sin, and will not obey. If the Lord Almighty
say the word, the heavens and all therein obey him :
but if he call but a drunkard out of an ale-house, he
will not obey : or if he call a worldly fleshly sinner to
deny himself, and mortify the flesh, and set his heart
upon a better inheritance, he will not obey.

If thou hadst any love in thee, thou wouldst know
the voice, and say, O this is my Father's call ! how
can I find in my heart to disobey ? For the sheep of
Christ " know and hear his voice, and they follow
him, and he giveth them eternal life." John, 10 : 4.
If thou hadst any spiritual life and sense in thee, at
least thou wouldst say, " This call is the dreadful
voice of God, and who dare disobey? For saith the
prophet, (Amos, 3 : 8,) " The lion hath roared, who
will not fear ?" God is not a man, that thou shouldst
dally and trifle with him. Remember what he said
to Paul at his conversion, " It is hard for thee to
kick against the 'pricks?'' Acts, 9 : 5. Wilt thou yet
go on and despise his word, and resist his Spirit, and
stop thine ear against his call? who is it that will
have the worst of this ? Dost thou know whom thou
disobeyest, and contendest with, and what thou art
doing ? It were a far wiser and easier task for thee to
contend with the thorns, and spurn them with thy
bare feet, and beat them with thy bare hands, or put
thine head into the burning fire. "Be not deceived,
God will not be mocked." Gal. 6 : 7. Whoever else



90 A CALL TO Doct. 5

be mocked, God will not : you had better play with
the fire in your thatch, than with the fire of his burn-
ing wrath. " For our God is a consuming fire." Heb.
12 : 29. O how unmeet a match art thou for God !
" It is a fearful thing to fall into his bauds." Heb.
10 : 31. And therefore it is a fearful thing to contend
with him, or resist him. As you love your own souls,
take heed what you do : what will you say if he begin
in wrath to piead with you? What will you do if he
take you once in hand ? will you then strive against
his judgment, as now ye do against his grace ? Isa.
27 : 4, 5. " Fury is not in me :" saith the Lord : (that
is) I delight not to destroy you : I do it, as it were un-
willingly ; but yet " who will set the briers and thorns
against me in battle? I would go through them, I
icouUl burn them together. Or let him take hold of
my strength, that he may mahe peace with me." It is
an unequal combat for the briers and stubble to make
war with the fire.

And thus you see who it is that calleth you, that
would move you to hear his call, and turn : so con-
sider aiso by what instruments, and how often, and
how earnestly he doth it.

1. Every leaf of the blessed book of God hath, as it
were, a voice, and calls out to thee, Turn, and live;
turn, or thou wilt die. Kow canst thou open it, and
read a leaf, or hear a chapter, and not perceive God
bids thee turn?

2. It is the voice of every sermon that thou nearest :
for what else is the scope and drift of all, but to cali,
and persuade, and entreat thee to turn.

3. It is the voice of many a motion of the Spirit that
secretly speaks over these words again, and urgetb
thee to turn.



Doct. 5- THE UNCONVERTED. 91

4. It is likely, sometimes it is the voice of thv own
conscience Art thou not sometimes convinced that
all is not well with thee ? And doth not thy con-
science tell thee that thou must be a new man ? and
take a new course, and often call upon thee to return ?

5. It is the voice of the gracious examples of the
godly. When thou seest them live a heavenly life,
and fly from the sin which is thy delight, this really
calls on thee to turn.

6. It is the voice of all the works of God : for they
also are God's books that teach thee this lesson, by
showing thee his greatness, and Wisdom, and good-
ness ; and calling thee to observe them, and admire
the Creator. Psalm 19 : 1, 2. " The heavens declare
the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his
handy work : day unto day uttereth speech,, night
unto night showeth knowledge." Every time the sun
riseth unto thee, it really calleth thee to turn, as if it
should say, " What do I travel and compass the world
for, but to declare to men the glory of their Maker,
and to light, them to do his work ? And do I still find
thee doing the work of sin, and sleeping out thy life
in negligence? Awake thou that sleepest, and arise
from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light."
Ephcs. 5 : 14. " The night is far spent, the day is
at hand ; it is now high time to awake out of sleep.
Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let
us put on the armor of light. Let us walk honestly
as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not m
chambering and wantonness, not in strife and enyy-
ing, but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make
not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."
Rom. 13 : 11, 14. This text was the means of Aus-
tin's conversion.



7. It is the voice of every mercy thou dost possess ;
if thou couldst but hear and understand them, they
all cry out unto thee, Turn. Why doth Ihe earth
bear thee, but to seek and serve the Lord ? Why
doth it afford thee its fruits, but to serve him? W T hy
doth the air afford thee breath, but to serve him?
Why do all the creatures serve thee with their labors
and their lives, but that thou mightest serve the Lord
of them and thee ? Why doth he give thee time,
and health, and strength, but only to serve him?
Why hast thou meat, and drink, and clothes, but for
his service ? Hast thou any thing which thou hast
not received ? and if thou didst receive them, it is rea-
son thou should st bethink thee from whom, and to
what end and use thou didst receive them. Didst
thou never cry to him for help in thy distress, and
didst thou not then understand that it was thy part to
turn and serve him, if he would deliver thee ? He
hath done his part, and spared thee yet longer, and
tried thee another, and another year ; and yet dost
thou not turn? You know the parable of the unfruit-
ful fig-tree, Luke, 13 : 7, 9. When the Lord had
said, " Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground V T
he was entreated to try it one year longer, and then
if it proved not fruitful, to cut it clown. Christ himself
there makes the application twice over, (ver. 3 and
5.) " Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
How many years hath God looked for the fruits of
love and holiness from thee, and hath found none, and
yet he hath spared thee ? How many a time, by thy
wilful ignorance, and carelessness, and disobedience,
hast thou provoked justice to say, " Cut him down,
why cumbereth he the ground?" And yet mercy
hath prevailed, and patience hath forborne the fatal



Doct. 5. THE UNCONVERTED. 93

blow, to this day. If thou hadst the understanding
of a man within thee, thou wouldst know that all tliis
calleth thee to turn. " Dost thou think thou shalt
Etill escape the judgment of God? or despisest thou
tlie riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-
suffering? not knowing that the goodness of God
leadeth thee to repentance. But, after thy hardnes3
and impenitent heart, treasurestup unto thyself wrath
against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righte-
ous judgment of God, who will render to every man
according to his deeds." Rom. 2 : 3—6.

8. Moreover, it is the voice of every affliction to call
thee to make haste and turn. Sickness and pain cry,
Turn : and poverty, and loss of friends, and every
twig of the chastening rod, cry, Turn. And yet wilt
thou not hearken to the call ? These have come near
thee, and made thee feel; they have made thee
groan, and can they not make thee turn ?

9. The very frame of thy nature and being itself,
bespeaketh thy return. Why hast thou reason, but to
rule thy flesh, and serve thy Lord ? Why hast thou
an understanding soul, but to learn and know his will
and do it ? Why hast thou a heart within thee that
can love, and fear, and desire, but that thou shouldst
fear him, and love him, and desire after him?

Lay all these together now, and see what should
be the issue. The holy Scriptures call upon thee to
turn; the ministers of Christ call upon thee to turn;
the Spirit cries, Turn ; thy conscience ones, Turn ;
(ho godly, by persuasions and example cry. Turn;
the whole world, and all the creatures therein that
are presented to thy consideration cry, Turn ; the pa-
tient forbearance of God cries, Turn ; all the mercies
which thou receivest cry, Turn; the rod of God'a



94 A CALL TO Doct. &.

chastisement cries Turn ; thy reason and the frame cf
thy nature bespeaks thy turning ; and so do all thy
promises to God ; and yet art thou not resolved to
turn?

III. Moreover, poor hard-hearted sinner, didst thou
ever consider upon what terms thou standest all this
while with Him that calleth on thee to turn ? Thou
art Ins own, and owest him thyself, and all thou hast;
and may he not command his own ? Thou art his
absolute servant, and shouldst serve no other master.
Thou standest a^. his mercy, and thy life is in his
hand, and he is resolved to save thee upon no other
terms; thou hast many malicious spiritual enemies
that would be glad if God would but forsake thee,
and let them alone with thee, and leave thee to their
will ; how quickly would they deal with thee in an-
other manner ! and thou canst not be delivered from
them but by turning unto God. Thou art fallen un -
der his wrath by thy sin already ; and thou knowest
not how long his patience will yet wait. Perhaps this
is the last year, perhaps the last day. His sword ia
even at thy heart while the word is in thine ear;
and if thou turn not, thou art a dead and undone
man. Were thy eyes but open to see where thou
standest, even upon the brink of hell, and to see how
many thousands are there already that did not turn,
thou wouldst see that it is time to look about thee.

Well, sirs, look inwards now and tell me how your
hearts are affected with those offers of the Lord. Yow
hear what is his mind : he delighteth not in your
death ; he calls to yon, Turn, turn : it is a fearful sigr*
if all this move thee not, or if it do but half move thee ,
and much more if it make thee more careless in thy
misery, because thou nearest of the mercifulness of



Doct. 5. THE UNCONVERTED. 95

God. The working of the medicine will partly teu
us whether there be any hope of the cure. O what
glad tidings would it be to those that are now in hell,
if they had but such a message from God! What a
joyful word would it be to hear this, Turn and live !
Yea, what a welcome word would it be to thyself,
when thou hast felt that wrath of God but an hour !
Or, if after a thousand or ten thousand years' torment,
thou couldst but hear such a word from God, Turn
and live ; and yet wilt thou neglect it, and suffer U3
to return without our errand ?

Behold, sinners, we are sent here as the messengers
ef the Lord, to set before you life and death. What
6ay you ? which of them will you choose ? Christ
standeth, as it were, by thee, with heaven in the one
hand, and hell in the other, and offereth thee thy
choice. Which wilt thou choose ? The voice of the
Lord maketh the rocks to tremble. Psalm 29. And is
it nothing to hear him threaten thee, if thou wilt not
turn 1 Dost thou not understand and feel this voice,
" Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die V Why ? It is
the voice of love, of infinite love, of thy best and kindest
friend, as thou mightest easily perceive by the motion;
and yet canst thou neglect it ? It is the voice of pity
and compassion. The Lord seeth whither thou art
going better than thou dost, which makes him call
after thee. Turn, turn. He seeth what will become
of thee, if thou turn not. He thinketh with himself,
" Ah ! this poor sinner will cast himself into endless
torments if he do not turn. I must in justice deal with
him according to my righteous law." And therefore
he calleth after thee, Turn, turn. O sinner ! If thou
didst but know the thousandth part, as well as God
doth, the danger that is near you, and the misery



96 A CALL TO Doct. fc

that you are running into, we should have no more
need to call after ycu to turn.

Moreover, this voice that calleth to thee is the same
that hath prevailed with thousands already, and called
all to heaven that are now there ; and they would not
now for a thousand worlds that they had made light
of it, and not turned to God. Now, what are they
possessing that turned at God's call ? Now they per-
ceive that it was indeed the voice of love, that meant
them no more harm than their salvation ; and if thou
wilt obey the same call thou shalt come to the same
happiness. There are millions that must for ever la-
ment that they turned not ; but there is never a soul
in heaven that is sorry that they were converted.

Well, sirs, are you yet resolved, or are you not?
Do I need to say any more to you? What will you
do? Will you turn or not ? Speak, man, in thy heart,
to God, though you speak not out to me ; speak, lest
he take thy silence for denial; speak quickly, lest he
never make thee the like offer more ; speak resolvedly,
and not waveringly, for he will have no indifferenta
to be his followers. Say in thine heart now, without
any more delay, even before thou stir hence, " By the
grace of God I am resolved presently to turn. And
because I know my own insufficiency, I am resolved
to wait on God for his grace, and to follow him in his
ways, and forsake my former courses and companions
and give up myself to the guidance of the Lord."

Sirs, you are not shut up in the darkness of hea-
thenism, nor in the desperation of the damned. Life
is before you, and you may have it on reasonable
ter ms, if you will : yea, on free cost, if you will accept
it. The way of God lieth plain before you ; the church
is t >pen to you. You may have Christ, and pardon,



i DocU 6. THE UNCONVERTED. 97

and holiness, if you will. What say you ? Will you
or will you not '? If you say nay, or say nothing, and
still go on, God is witness, and this congregation is
witness, and your awn consciences are witnesses, how
fair an offer you had this day. Remember, you might
have had Christ, and would not. Remember, when
ycu have lost it, that you might have had eternal life,
as well as others, and would not ; and all because you
would not turn !

But let us come to the next doctrine, and hear your
reasons.

DOCTRINE VI.

The Lord condescendeth to reason the case with
unconverted sinners, and to ask them why they
■will die.

A strange disputation it is, both as to tho contro-
versy and as to the disputants.

I. The controversy, or question propounded to dis-
pute of is, Why wicked men will destroy themselves?
or, Why they will rather die than turn; whether
they have any sufficient reason for so doing ?

II. The disputants are God and man : the most
holy God, and wicked unconverted sinners.

Is it not a strange thing, winch God doth here seem
to suppose, that any man should be willing to die and
be damned ? yea, that this should be the case of the
wicked ? that is, of the greatest part of the world. But
you will say, " This cannot be ; for nature desireth
the preservation and felicity of itself; and the wicked
are more selfish than others, and not less ; and there-
tore how can any man be willing to be damned ?"

To which I answer :— 1. It is a certain truth that

Bax. CalL 9



98 A CALL TO Doct. 6 '.

no man can be willing to bear any evil, as evil, but
only as it hath some appearance of good ; much less
can any man be willing to be eternally tormented,.
Misery, as such, is desired by none. 2. But yet for
all that, it is most true which God here teacheth us,
that tile cause why the wicked die is, because they
will die. And this is true in several respects.

1, Because they will go the way that leads to hell,
although they are told by God and man whither it
goes and whither it ends ; and though God hath so
often professed in his word, that if they hold on in
that way they shall be condemned ; and that they
shall not be saved unless they turn. Isa. 48 : 22; 57 :
21 j 59 : 8, " There is no peace, saith the Lord, to the
wicked." " The way of peace they know not ; there
is no judgment in their goings ; they have made them
crooked paths. Whosoever goeth therein shall not
know peace." They have the word and the oath of
the living God for it, that if they will not turn they
shall not enter into his rest : and yet, wicked they are.
and wicked they will be, let God and man say what
they will : fleshly they are, and fleshly they will be,
worldlings they are, and worldlings they will be,
though God hath told them that the love of the world
is enmity to God, and that if any man love the world
(in that measure) the love of the Father is not in him
James, 4 : 4 ; 1 John, 2 : 15. So that, consequently,
these men are willing to be damned, though not di-
rectly ; they are willing to walk in the way to hell,
and love the certain cause of their torment ; though
they do not will hell itself, and do not love the pain
which they must endure.

Is not this the truth of your case sirs ? You woulo
not burn in hell, but you will kindle the fire by your



Doct. 6. THE UNCONVERTED. 99

sins, and cast yourselves into it ; you would not be
tormented with devils for ever, but you will do that
which will certainly procure it in spite of all that can
be said against it. It is just as if you would say, " I
will drink this poison, but yet I will not die. I will
cast myself headlong from the top of a steeple, but yet
I will not kill myself. I will thrust this knife into my
heart, but yet I will not take away my life. I will put
this fire into the thatch of my house, but yet I will not
burn it." Just so it is with wicked men ; they will be
wicked, and they will live after the flesh and the
world, and yet they would not be damned. But do
you not know that the means lead to the end ? and
that God hath, by his righteous law, concluded that
ye must repent or perish ? He that will take poison
may as well say plainly, I will kill myself, for it will
prove no better in the end ; though perhaps he loved
it for the sweetness of the sugar that was mixed with
it, and would not be persuaded that it was poison,
but that he might take it and do well enough ; but it
is not his conceits and confidence that will save his
life. So if you will be drunkards, or fornicators, or
worldlings, or live after the flesh, you may as well
say plainly, We will be damned ; for so you wall be
unless you turn. Would you not rebuke the folly of a
murderer that would say I will kill, but I will not be
hanged, when he knows that if he does the one, the
judge in justice will see that the other be done ? If he
say I will murder, he may as well say plainly, I will
be hanged ; and if you will go on in a carnal life, you
may as well say plainly, We will go to hell.

2. Moreover, the wicked will not use those means
without which there is no hope of their salvation. He
that will not eat, may as well say plainly, he will



100 A CALL TO DocC •

not live, unless he can tell how to live without meat
He that will not go his journey, may as well say
plainly he will not come to the end. He that falls i nto
the water, and will not come out, nor suffer another
to help him out, may as well say plainly, he will be
drowned. So if you be carnal and ungodly, and will
not be converted, nor use the means by which you
should be converted, but think it more ado than needs,
you may as well say plainly you will be damned ; for
if you have found out a way to be saved without con-
version, you have done that which was never done
before.

3. Yea, this is not all ; but the wicked are unwilling
even to partake of salvation itself; though they may
desire somewhat which they call by the name of hea-
ven, yet heaven itself, considered in the true nature
of the felicity, they desire not; yea, their hearts are
quite against it. Heaven is a state of perfect holiness,
and of continual love and praise to God, and the
wicked have no heart to this. The imperfect love,
and praise, and holiness, which is here to be attained,
they have no mind for ; much less for that which is
so much greater. The joys of heaven are of so pure
and spiritual a nature that the heart of the wicked
cannot truly desire them.

So that by this time you may see on what ground
it is that God supposeth that the wicked are willing
their own destruction. They will not turn, though
they must turn or die : they will rather venture on
certain misery than be converted ; and then to quiet
themselves in their sins, they will make themselves
believe that they shall nevertheless escape.

II. And as this controversy is matter of wonder, in
that men should be such enemies to themselves as



Doct. 6. THE UNCONVERTED. 101

wilfully to cast away their souls, so are the disputants
too : that God should stoop so low as thus to plead the
case with men ; and that men should be so strangely
blind and obstinate as to need all tins in so plain a
case ; yea, and to resist all tins, when their own sal-
vation lieth upon the issue.

No wonder that they will not hear us that are men
when they will not hear the Lord himself. As God
saith, (Ezek. 3 : 7.) when he sent the prophet to the
Israelites, " The house of Israel will not hearken
unto thee ; for they will not hearken unto me ; for all
the house of Israel are impudent and hard-hearted."
No wonder if they can plead against a minister, or a
godly neighbor, when they will plead against the
Lord himself, even against the plainest passages oi
his word, and think that they have reason on their
side. When they weary the Lord with their words,
they say, " Wherein have we wearied him?" Mai.
2 : 17. The priests that despised his name durst ask,
" Wherein have we despised thy name ?" And
" when they polluted his altar, and made the table
of the Lord contemptible," they durst say, " Wherein
have we polluted thee ?" Mai. 1 : 6. 7. But " Wo
unto him (saith the Lord) that striveth with his Ma-
ker ! Let the potsherds strive with the potsherds of
the earth : shall the clay say to him that fashioneth
it, What makest thou V

Quest. But why is it that God will reason the case
with man ?

Answ. 1. Because that man being a reasonable
creature, is accordingly to be dealt with, and by rea-
son to be persuaded and overcome ; God hath there-
fore endowed them with reason, that they might use
it for him. One would think a reasonable creature



102 A CALL TO I)oct. 8

should not go against the clearest, the greatest reason
in the world, when it is set before him.

2. At least, men shall see that God did require no-
thing of them that was unreasonable ; but both in what
he commandeth them, and what he forbids them, he
hath all the right reason in the world on his side;
and they have good reason to obey him — but none to
disobey him. And thus even the damned shall be
forced to justify God, and confess that it was only rea-
sonable that they should have turned to him ; and
they shall be forced to condemn themselves, and con-
fess that they had little reason to cast away them •
selves by the neglecting of his grace in the day of
their visitation.

Use. — Look up your best and strongest reasons, sin«
ners, if you will make good your way. You see now
with whom you have to deal. What sayest thou,
unconverted sensual sinner ? Darest thou venture
upon a dispute with God ? Art thou able to confute
him ? Art thou ready to enter the lists ? God asketh
thee, Why wilt thou die? Art thou furnished with a
sufficient answer? Wilt thou undertake to prove
that God is mistaken, and that thou art in the right ?
O what an undertaking is that! Why, cither he or
you are mistaken, when he is for your conversion, and
you are against it : he calls upon you to turn, and
you will not ; he bids you do it presently, even to-day,
while it is called to-day, and you delay, and think it
time enough hereafter. He saith it must be a total
change, and you must be holy and new creatures, and
born again; and you think that less may serve the
turn, and that it is enough to patch up the old man,
without becoming new. Who is in the right now?



poet. 6. THE UNCONVERTED. 103

God or yon ? God calleth you to turn, and to live a
holy life, and you will not : by your disobedient lives
it appears you will not. Jf you will, why do you not'?
Why have you not done it all this while ? And why
do you not fall upon it yet ? Your wills have the
command of your lives. We may certainly conclude
that you are unwilling to turn when you do not turn.
And why will you not ?

Can you give any reason for it that is worthy to
be called a reason ?

I that am but a worm, your fellow creature, of a
shallow capacity, dare challenge the wisest of you
all to reason the case with me while I plead my Ma-
ker's cause ; and I need not be discouraged when I
know I plead but the cause that God pleadetli, and
contend for him that will have the best at last. Had
I but these two general grounds against you, I am
sure that you have no good reason on your side.

I am sure it can be no good reason which is against
the God of truth and reason. It cannot be light that
is contrary to the sun. There is no knowledge in any
creature but what it had from God ; and therefore
none can be wiser than God. It were fatal presump-
tion for the highest angel to compare with his Crea-
tor ! What is it then for a lump of earth, an ignorant
sot, that knoweth not himself nor his own soul, that
knoweth but little of the things which he seeth, yea,
that is more ignorant than many of his neighbors, to
set himself against the wisdom of the Lcrd ! It is one
of the fullest discoveries of the horrible wickedness of
carnal men, and the stark madness of such as si%
that so silly a mole dare contradict his Maker, and
call in question the word of God: yea, that those
people in our parishes that are so ignorant that they

cannot give us a reasonable answer concerning the
very principles of religion, are yet so wise in their
own conceit, that they dare question the plainest
truths of God, yea, contradict them, and cavil against
them, when they can scarcely speak sense, and will
believe them no further than agreeth with their fool-
ish wisdom !

And as I know that God must needs be in the right,
eo I know the cause is so palpable and gross which
he pleadeth against, that no man can have reason
for it. Is it possible that a man can have any reason
to break his Maker's laws, and reason to dishonor the
Lord of glory, and reason to abuse the Lord that
bought him? Is it possible that a man can have any
good reason to damn his own immortal soul ? Mark the
Lord's question, Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?
Is eternal death a thing to be desired ? Are you in love
with hell ? What reason have you wilfully to perish ?
If you think you have some reason to sin, should you
not remember that death is the wages of sin, (Rom.
6: 23.) and think whether you have any reason to
undo yourselves, body and soul for ever? You should
not only ask whether you love the adder, but whether
you love the sting ? It is such a thing for a man to cast
away his everlasting happiness, and 1o sin against
God, that, no good reason can be given for it ; but the
more any one pleads for it. the more mad he showeth
himself to be. Had you a lordship, or a kingdorr
offered you for every sin that you commit, ii were not
reason, but madness to accept it. Could you by every
sin obtain the highest thing on earth that flesh desireth,
it were of no considerable value to persuade you in
reason to commit it. If it were to please your great-
est or den rest friends, or to obey the greatest prince on



Doct. 6. THE UNCONVERTED. 105

earth, or to save your lives, or to escape the greatest
earthly misery; all these are of no consideration to
draw a man in reason to the committing of one sin.
If it were a right hand, or a right eye that would
hi ruler your salvation, it is the most gainful way to
cast ii avvay, rather than to go to hell to save it ; lor
there is no saving a part when you lose the whole.
So exceedingly great are the matters of eternity, that
ncthing in this world deserveth once to be named in
ccmpa;ison with them; nor can any earthly thing,
though it were life, or crowns, or kingdoms, he a rea-
sonable excuse for the neglect of matters of such high
and everlasting consequence. A man can have no
reason to crf/ss his ultimate end. Heaven is such a
thing, that if you lose it, nothing can supply the want,
or make up the loss; and hell is such a thing, that if
yon r-uffer it, nothing can remove your misery, or give
you ease and comfort; and therefore nothing can
be a valuable consideration to excuse you for neg-
lecting your own salvation; for, saith our Savior,
" What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the
whole world, and lose his own soul?" Mark, 8: 36.
O sirs, that you did but know what matters they are
that we are now speaking to you of! you would have
other kind of thoughts of these things. If the devil
could come to the saints in heaven that live in the
eight and love of God, and should offer them sensual
pleasures, or merry company, or sports to entice them
avvay from God and glory, I pray you tell me, how do
you think they would entertain the motion ? Nay, or
if he should offer them to be kings on the earth, do you
think this would entice them down from heaven ? O
with what hatred and holy scorn would they reject
the motion ! And why should not you do so, that have



106 A CALL TO Dcct. 6.

heaven opened to your faith, if you had but faith to see
it ? There is never a soul in hell but knows, by this
time, that it was a mad exchange to let go heaven
for fleshly pleasure : and that it is not a little mirth,
or pleasure, or worldly riches, or honor, -or the good
will or word of men, that will quench hell fire, or
make him a gainer that loseth his soul. O if you had
heard what I believe, if you had seen what I believe,
and that on the credit of the word of God, you would
say there can be no reason to warrant a man to destroy
his soul ; you durst not sleep quietly another night,
before you had resolved to turn and live.

If you see a man put his hand in the fire till it
burn off, you will marvel at it; but this is a thing that
a man may have a reason for, as Bishop Cranmer had
when he burnt off his hand for subscribing to Popery.
If you see a man cut off a leg, or an arm, it is a sad
sight; but this is a thing that a man may have a
good reason for, as many a man hath it done to save
his life. If you see a man give his body to be tor-
mented with scourges and racks, or to be burned to
ashes, and refuse deliverance when it is offered, thia
is a hard case to flesh and blood ; but this a man may
have good reason for. as you may see in Heb. 11: 33,
36, and as many a hundred martyrs have done. But
for a man to forsake the Lord that made him, and to
run into the fire of hell when he is told of it, and en-
treated to turn that he may be saved — this is a thing
that can have no reason in the world to justify or ex-
cuse it. For heaven will pay for the loss of any thing
that we can lose to obtain it, or for any labor which
we bestow for it ; but nothing can pay for the loss of
heaven.

I beseech you now let this word come nearer to youj



Doet. 6. THE UNCONVERTED. 10?

heart. As you are convinced that you have no reason
to destroy yourselves, so tell me what reason have you
to refuse to turn and live to God ? What reason has
the veriest worldling, or dmnkard, or ignorant careless
sinner of you all, why he should not be as holy as any
you know, and be as careful for his soul as any other?
Will not hell be as intolerable to you as to others ?
Should not your own souls be as dear to you as theirs
to them ? Hath not God as much authority over you?
Why then will you not become a sanctified people, as
well as they?

O, sirs, when God bringeth the matter down to the
very principles of nature, and shows that you have
no more reason to be ungodly than you have to damn
your own souls — if yet you will not understand and
turn, it seems a desperate case that you are m.

And now, either you have good reason for what you
do, or you have not : if not, will you go against rea-
son itself? Will you do that which you have no rea-
son for? But if you think you have a reason, produce
it, and make the best of your matter. Reason the
case a little with me, your fellow creature, which is
far easier than to reason the case with God; tell me,
man, here before the Lord, as if thou wert to die this
hour, why should est thou not resolve to turn this day,
before thou stir from the place thou standest in ; wha.1
reason hast thou to deny or to delay? Hast thou any
reasons that satisfy thine own conscience for it, or any
that thou darest own and plead at the bar of God? If
thou hast, let us hear them, bring them forth, and
make them good. But, alas ! what poor stuflj what
nonsense, instead of reasons, do we daily hear from
ungodly men! But for their necessity I should be
ashamed to name them.

Objection 1. One saith. if none shall be saved but
such converted and sanctified ones as you talk of, then
heaven would be but empty ; then God help a great
many !

Answer. Why, it seems you think that God doth
not know, or else that he is not to be believed ! Mea-
sure not all by yourselves : God hath thousands and
millions of his sanctified ones; but yet they are few
in comparison of the world, as Christ himself hath
told us, Matt. 7 : 13, 14. Luke, 11 : 32. It better be-
seems you to make that use of this truth which Christ
leacheth you: " Strive to enter in at the strait gate ;
for strait is the gate and narrow is the way that
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it j but
wide is the gate and broad is the way which leadeth
to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat."
Luke, 13 : 22—24. Fear not, little flock, (saith Christ
to his sanctified ones,) for it is your Father's good
pleasure to give you the kingdom. Luke, 12 : 32.

Object. 2. I am sure, if such as I go to hell, we shall
have store of company.

Answ. And will that be any ease or comfort to you?
Or do you think you may not have company enough
in heaven? Will you be undone for company, or will
you not believe that God will execute his threaten-
ings, because there be so many that are guilty? These
ere all unreasonable conceits.

Object. 3. But ail men are sinners, even the best oi
you all.

Answ. But all are not unconverted sinners. The
godly live not in gross sins; and their very infirmities
are their grief and burden, which they daily long,
and pray, and strive to be rid of. Sin hr.th not do-
minion over them.



Doct.6. THE UNCONVERTED. 109

Object. 4. I do not see that professors are any bettei
than other men; they will overreach, and oppress,
and are as covetous as any.

Answ. Whatever hypocrites are, it is not so with
those that are sanctified. God hath thousands, and
tens of thousands that are otherwise, though the ma-
licious world doth accuse them of what they can never
prove, and of that which never entered into their
hearts; and commoniy they charge them with heart-
sins, which none can see but God, because they can
charge them with no such wickedness in their lives
as they are guilty of themselves.

Object. 5. But I am no whoremonger, nor drunkard,
nor oppressor ; and therefore why should you call upon
me to be converted ?

Answ. As if you were not born after the flesh, and
had not lived after the flesh, as well as others ! Is it
not as great a sin as any of these, for a man to have
an earthly mind, and to love the world above God,
and to have an unbelieving, unhumbled heart ? Nay,
let me tell you more, that many persons that avoid
disgraceful sins are as fast glued to the world, and as
much slaves to the flesh, and as strange to God, and
averse to heaven in their more civil course, as others
are in their more shameful notorious sins.

Object. 6. But I mean nobody any harm, nor do
any harm ; and why then should God condemn me?

Answ. Is it no harm to neglect the Lord that made
thee, and the w r ork for winch thou earnest into the
world, and to prefer the creature before the Creator,
and to neglect grace that is daily offered thee? It is
the depth of thy sinfulness to be so insensible of it :
the dead feel not that they are dead. If once thou

Bax. Call. jq



110 A CALL TO Doct. *

wert made alive, thou wouldst see more amiss in thv
self, and marvel at thyself for making so light of it.

Object. 7. I think you would make men mad, under
pretence of converting them: it is enough to rack the
brains of simple people to muse so much on matters
bo high for them.

Answ. 1. Can you be more mad than you are al-
ready? or, at >ast, can there be a more dangerous
madness than to neglect your everlasting welfare,
and wilfully undo yourselves ?

2. A man is never well in his wits till he be con-
verted: he never knows God, nor knows sin, nor knows
Christ, nor knows the world, nor himself, nor what his
Dusiness is on earth, so as to set himself about it, till
he be converted. The Scripture saith, that the wicked
are unreasonable men, (2 Thess. 3 : 2,) and that the
wisdom of the world is foolishness with God. 1 Cor.
1 : 20. and Luke 15 : 17. It is said of the prodigal,
that when he came to himself he resolved to return.
What a strange wisdom is this; men will disobey
God, and run to hell, for fear of being out of their wits?

3. What is there in the work that Christ calls you
to, that should drive a man out of his Avits ? Is it the
loving God, and calling upon him, and comfortably
thinking of the glory to come, and the forsaking of
our sins, and loving one another, and delighting our-
eelves in the service of God % Are these such things
as should make men mad ?

4. And whereas you say that these matters are too
high for us ; you accuse God himself for making this our
work', and giving us his word, and commanding all
that will be blessed to meditate on it day and n ; ght«
Are the matters which we are made for, and which
we live for, toe high for us to meddle with ? This i§



OocV6. THE UNCONVERTED. Ill

plainly to unman us. and to make beasts of us, as if
we were like them that must meddle with no higher"
matters than what belongs to flesh and earth. If
heaven be too high for you to think on and provide
for, it will be too high for you ever to possess.

5. If God should sometimes surfer any weak-headed
persons to be distracted by thinking of eternal things,
this is because they misunderstand them, and run
without a guide ; and of the two, I had rather be in
the case of such a one, than of the mad unconverted
world, that take their distraction to be their wisdom.

Object. 8. I do not think that God cares so much
what men think, or speak, or do, as to make so great
a matter of it.

Answ. It seems, then, you take the word of God to
be false : then what will you believe ? But your own
reason might teach you better, if you believe not the
scriptures; for you see God sets not so light by us but
that he vouchsafed to make us, and still preserveth us,
and daily upholdeth us, and provideth for us ; and will
any wise man make a curious frame for nothing?
Will you make or buy a clock or watch, and daily
look at it, and not care whether it go true or false ?
Surely, if you believe not a particular eye of Provi-
dence observing your hearts and lives, you camiot be-
lieve or expect any particular Providence to observe
your wants and troubles, or to relieve you; and it
God had so little care for you as you imagine, you
would never have lived till now ; a hundred diseases
would have striven which should first destroy you ;
yea, the devils would have haunted you, and fetched
you away alive, as the great fishes devour the less,
and as ravenous beasts and birds devour others. You
cannot think that God made man for no end or use;



112 A CALL TO Doei.%.

and if he made him for any, it was sureiy for himself j
and can you think he cares not whether his end be
accomplished, and whether we do the work that we
are made for 1

Yea, by this atheistical objection you make God to
have made and upheld all the world in vain ; for what
are all other lower creatures for, but for man ? Whai
doth the earth but bear us and nourish us, and the
beasts but serve us with their labors and lives, and so
of the rest? And hath God made so glorious a habita-
tion, and set man to dwell in it, and made all his ser-
vants ; and now doth he look for nothing at Ins hands,
nor care how he thinks, or speaks, or lives ? This is
most unreasonable.

Object. 9. It was a better world when men did not
make so much ado in religion.

Answ. 1. It hath ever been the custom to praise the
times past ; that world that you speak of was wont to
say it was a better world in their forefathers' days ;
and so did they of their forefathers. This is but an
old custom, because Ave all feel the evil of our own
times, but we see not that which was before us.

2. Perhaps you speak as you think. Worldlings
think the world is at the best when it is agreeable to
their minds, and when they have most mirth and
worldly pleasure; and I doubt not but the devil, as well
as you, would say, that then it was a better wor -d ,
for then he had more service, and less disturbance.
But the world is at the best when God is most loved,
regarded, and obeyed ; and how else will you know
when the world is good or bad, but by this?

Object. 10. There are so many ways and religions,
that we know not which to be of, and therefore we
will be even as we are.



Dott.6. T HE UNCONVERTED. 113

Answ. Because there are many, will you be of that
way that you may he sure is wrong ? None are further
out of the way than worldly, fleshly, unconverted sin-
ners; for they do not only err in this or that opinion,
as many sects do, but in the very scope and drift of
their lives. If you were going a journey that your
life la}* on, would you stop, or turn again, because you
met with some cross-ways, or because you saw some
travellers go the horse-way, and some the loot-way,
and some perhaps break over tne hedge, yea, and
some miss the way ? Or would you not rather be the
more careful to inquire the way? If you have some
servants that know not how to do your work right,
and some that are unfaithful, would you take it well
of any of the rest that would therefore be idle and do
you no service, because they see their companions
so bad?

Object. 11. I do not see that it goes any better with
those that are so godly, than with other men; they
are as poor and in as much trouble as others.

Ansio. And perhaps in much more, when God sees
it meet. They take not eartrdy prosperity for their
wages; they have laid up their treasure and hopes in
another world, or else they are not Christians indeed;
the less they have, the more is behind, and they are
content, to wait till then.

Object. 12. When you have said all that you can, I
am resolved to hope well, and trust in God, and do aa
well as I can, and not make so much ado.

AnsiD. 1. Is that doing as well as you can, when
you will not turn to God, but your heart is against
his holy and diligent service? It is as well as you will,
indeed, but thac is your misery.

2. My desire is, that you should hope and trust ifl
"io*



114 A CALL TO Doct. 6.

God. Bat for what is it that you will hope? Is it to
be saved, if you turn and be sanctified? For this you
have God's promise, and therefore hope for it, and
spare not. But if you hope to be saved without con-
version, and a holy life, this is not to hope in God, but
in Satan, or yourselves ; for God hath given you no
such promise, but told you the contrary ; but it is
Satan and self-love that made you such promises, and
raised you to such hopes.

Well, if these, and such as these, be all you have
to say against conversion, and a holy life, your all is
nothing, and worse than nothing; and if these, and
such as these, seem reasons sufficient to persuade you
to forsake God, and cast yourselves into hell, the Lord
deliver you from such reasons, and from such blind
understandings, and from such senseless hardened
hearts. Dare you stand to aver one of these reasons
at the bar of God ? Do you think it will then serve
your turn to say, " Lord, I did not turn, because I had
so much to do in the Avorld, or because I did not like
the lives of some professors, or because I saw men of
so many minds!" O how easily will the light of that
day confound and shame such reasonings as these !
Had you the world to look after? Let the world which
you served now pay you your wages, and save you if
it can. Had you not a better world to look after first,
and were ye not commanded to seek first God's king-
dom and righteousness, and promised that other things
should be added to you ? Matt. 6 : 33. And were ye
not told, that godliness was profitable to ail things,
having the promise of this life, and that which is to
come? 1 Tim. 4 : 8. Did the sins of the professors
hinder you ? You should rather have been the more
heedfuL, and learned by their falls to beware, and have



Doct. 6. THE UNCONVERTED. 115

been the more careful, and not to be more careless. It
■was the Scripture, and not their lives, that was your
rule. Did the many opinions of the world hinder
you? Why the Scripture that was your rule did
teach you but one way, and that was the right way.
If you had followed that, even in so much as was plain
and easy, you should never have miscarried. Will
not such answers as these confound and silence you ?
If these will not, God hath those that will. When
he asked the man, " Friend, how earnest thou in
hither, not having on a wedding garment?" Matt.
22 : 12, that is, what dost thou in my church among
professed Christians, without a holy heart and life —
what answer did he make? Why. the text saith, "he
was speechless ; : ' he had nothing to say. The clear-
ness of the i^ase, and the majesty of God, will then
easily stop the mouths of the most confident of you,
though you will not be put down by any thing we
can say to you now, but will make good your cause
be it ever so bad. I know already that never a reason
that now you can give me will do you any good at
last, when your case must be opened before the Lord,
and all the world.

Nay, I scarce think that your own consciences are
well satisfied with your reasons ; for if they are, it
seems, then, you have not so much as a purpose to
repent. But if you do purpose to repent, it seems
you do not put much confidence in your reasons which
you bring against it.

What say you, unconverted sinners ? Have you
any good reasons to give why you should not turn,
and presently turn with all your hearts ? Or will you
go to hell in despite of reason itself? Bethink you
what you do in time, for it will shortly be too late to



116 A CALL TO D«t. «.

bethink you. Can you find any fault with God, or
his work, or his wages ? Is he a bad master ? Is the
devil, whom ye serve, a better ? or is the flesh a bet-
ter ? Is there any harm in a holy life ? Is a life of
worldliness and ungodliness better ? Do you think in
your consciences that it would do you any harm to be
converted and live a holy life ? What harm can it
do you ? Is it harm to you to have the Spirit of Christ
within you, and to have a cleansed purified heart ?
If it be bad to be holy, why doth God sav, " Be ye
holy, for I am holy?" 1 Pet. 1 : 15, 16; Lev. 20 : 7.
Is it evil to be like God ? Is it not said that God made
man in his own image? Why, this holiness is his
image ; this Adam lost, and this Christ by his word
and Spirit would restore to you, as he doth to all that
he will save. Tell me truly, as before the Lord,
though you are loth to live a holy life, had you not
rather die in the case cf those that do so, than of
others ? If you were to die this day, had you not ra
ther die in the case of a converted man than of an un •
converted? of a holy and heavenly man than of a
carnal earthly man? and wouid you not say as Ba-
laam. (Numb. 23 : 10.) " Let me die the death of the
righteous, and let my last end be like his I" An-1 why
will you not now be of the mind that you will be of
then? First or last you must come to this, either to
be converted, or to wish you had been, when it is
too late.

But what is it that yen are afraid of losing, if you
i.urn ? Is it your friends? You Avill but change them ;
God will be your friend, and Christ and the Spirit
will be your friend ; and every Christian will be your
friend. You will get one friend that will stand you in
more stead than all the friends in the world could have



Doct 6 THE UNCONVERTED. 117

done. The friends you lose would have but enticed
you to hell, but could not have delivered you : but the
friend you get will save you from hell, and bring you
10 his own eternal rest.

, Is it your pleasures that you are afraid of losing ?
You think you shall never have a merry day again
f or.ce \*ou be converted. Alas ! that you should think
t a greater pleasure to live in foolish sports and mer-
riments, and please your flesh, than to live in the be-
lieving thoughts of glory, and in the love of God, and
in righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost, in which the state of grace consisteth. Rom.
14 : 17. If it would be a greater pleasure for you to
think of your lands and inheritance, if you were lord
of all the country, than it is for a child to play at pins,
why should it not be a greater joy to you to think of
the kingdom of heaven being yours, than of all the
riches or pleasures of the world? As it is but foolish
childishness that makes children so delight in toys
that they would not leave them for all your lands, so
it is but foolish worldliness, and fleshliness, and wick-
edness, that makes you so much delight in your houses
and lands, and meat and drink, and ease and honor,
:is that you would not part with them for the heaven-
ly delights. But what will you do for pleasure when
these are gone ? Do you not think of that ? When
your pleasures end in horror, and go out like a taper,
the pleasures of the saints are then at the best. I have
had myself but a little taste of the heavenly pleasures
In the forethoughts of the blessed approaching day,
and in the present persuasions of the love of God in
Christ ; but I have taken too deep a draught of earth-
ly pleasures : so that you may see, if I be partial, it is
on vour side ; and yet I must profess from that little



118 A CALL TO Doct. 5.

experience, that there is no comparison. There ig
more joy to be had in a day, if the sun of life shine
clear upon us, in the state of holiness, than in a whole
life of sinful pleasures. " I had rather be a door-keeper
in the nOuse of God than to dwell in the tents of wick-
edness." Psalm 84 : 10. " A day in his courts is better
than a thousand" any where else. Psalm 84 : 10. The
mirth of the wicked is like the laughter of a madman,
that knows not his own misery ; and therefore Solo-
mon says of such laughter, ' : it is mad ; and of mirth,
what doth it?" Eccles. 2 : 2 ; 7 : 2, 6. "It is better
to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house
of feasting ; for that is the end of all men, and the liv-
ing will lay it to his heart. Sorrow is better than
laughter ; for by the sadness of the countenance the
heart is made better. The heart of the wise is in the
house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the
house of mirth. It is better to bear the rebuke of the
wise, than to hear the song of fools ; for as the crack-
ling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the
fool." Your loudest laughter is but like that of a man
that is tickled ; he laughs when he has no cause of
joy. Judge, as you are men, whether this be a wise
man's part. It is but your carnal unsanctified nature
that makes a holy life seem grievous to you, and a
course of sensuality seem more delightful. If you will
but turn, the Holy Ghost will give you another na-
ture and inclination, and then it will be more pleasan'
to you to be rid of your sin, than now it is to keep it
and you will then say, that you knew not what ?•
comfortable life was till now, and that it was nevei
well with you till God and holiness were your delighi.
Question. But how cometh it to pass that met
should be so unreasonable in the matters of salvation '<



Doo. 0. THE UNCONVERTED. 119

They have wit enough in other matters : what makes
thein so loth to be convened that there should need
so many words in so plain a case, and all will not do,
but the most will live and die unconverted ?

Answer. To name them only in a few words, the
causes are these :

1. Men are naturally in love with the earth and
flesh : they are born sinners, and their nature hath an
enmity to God and goodness, as the nature of a ser-
pent hath to a man : and when all that we can say
goes against an habitual inclination of their natures,
no marvel if it prevail little.

2. They are in darkness, and know not the very
things they hear. Like a man that was born blind,
and hears a high commendation of the light; but
what will hearing do, unless he sees it ? They know
not what God is, nor what is the power of the cioss
of Christ, nor what the Spirit of holiness is, nor what
it is to live in love by faith : they know not the cer-
tainty, and suitableness, and excellency of the hea-
venly inheritance. They know not what conversion
and a holy mind and conversation is, even when they
hear of it. They are in a mist of ignorance. They
are lost and bewildered in sin ; like a man that has
lost himself in the night, and knows not where he is,
nor how to come to himself again, till the daylight
recover him.

3. They are wilfully confident that they need no
conversion, but some partial amendment, and that
they are in the way to heaven already, and are con-
verted when they are not. And if you meet a man
that is quite out of his way, you may long enough
call on him to tum back again, if he will not believe
you that he is out of the way.



120 A CALL TO D°et. 6.

4. They are become slaves to their flesh, and
drowned in the world, to make provision fbi it. Their
lusts, and passions, and appetites, have distracted
them, and got such a hand over them tint they can-
not tell how to deny them, or how to mind any thing
else ; so that the drunkard saith, I love a cup of good
drink, and I cannot forbear it ; the glutton saith, I
love good cheer, and I cannot forbear ; the fornicator
saith, I love to have my lust fulfilled, and I cannot
forbear ; and the gamester loves to have his sports,
and he cannot forbear. So that they are become even
captivated slaves to their flesh, and their very wilful-
ness is become an impotency ; and what they would
not do, they say they cannot. And the worldling is
so taken up with earthly things, that he hath neither
heart, nor mind, nor time, for heavenly; but, as in
Pharaoh's dream, Gen. 41 : 4, the lean kine did eat
up the fat ones ; so this lean and barren earth doth
eat up all the thoughts of heaven.

5. Some are so carried away by the stream of evil
company, that they are possessed with hard thoughts
of a godly life, by hearing them speak against it ; or
at least they think they may venture to do as they
see most do, and so they hold on in their sinful ways ;
and when one is cut off, and cast into hell, and an-
other snatched away from among them to the same
condemnation, it doth not much daunt them, because
they see not whither they are gone. Poor wretches,
they hold on in their ungodliness for all this ; for they
little know that their companions are now lamenting
it in torments. In Luke 10, the rich man in hell wouln
fain have had one to warn his five brethren, lest they
should come to that place of torment. It is likely he
knew their mirds and lives, and knew that they were

hasting thither, and little dreamt that he was there,
yea, and would little have believed one that should
have told them so. I remember a passage that a gen-
tleman, yet living, told me he saw upon a bridge over
the Severn * A man was driving a flock of fat lambs,
and something meeting them, and hindering their
passage, one of the lambs leapt upon the wall of the
bridge, and his legs slipping from under him he fell
into the stream ; the rest seeing him, did, one after
cne, leap over the bridge into the stream, and were all
jr almost all drowned. Those that were behind did
little know what was become of them that were gone
before ; but thought they might venture to follow their
companions ; but as soon as ever they were over the
wall, and falling headlong, the case was altered.
Even so it is with unconverted carnal men. One dieth
by them, and drops into hell, and another follows the
same way ; and yet they will go alter them, because
they think not whither they are gone. O, but when
death hath once opened their eyes, and they see what
is on the other side of the wall, even in another world,
then what would they give to be where they were !

6. Moreover, they have a subtle malicious enemy
that is unseen of them, and plays his game in the
dark ; and it is his principal business to hinder their
conversion ; and therefore to keep them where they
are, by persuading them not to believe the Scriptures,
or not to trouble their minds with these matters ; or
by persuading them to think ill of a godly life, or to
think that more is enjoined than need be, and that
diey may be saved without conversion, and without
all this stir ; and that God is so merciful that he will
aot damn any such as they ; or at least, that they may

stay a little longer, and take their pleasure, and fol-
low the world a little longer yet, and then let it go,
and repent hereafter. And by such juggling, delud-
ing cheats as these, the devil keeps the mcst in his
captivity, and leadeth them to his misery.

These, and such like impediments as these, do keep
so many thousands unconverted, when God hath done
so much, and Christ hath suffered so much, and mi-
nisters have said so much for their conversion : when
their reasons are silenced and they are not able to
answer the Lord that calls after them, " Turn ye,
turn ye, why will ye die V* yet all comes to nothing
with the greatest part of them ; and they leave us no
more to do after all, but to sit down and lament their
wilful misery.

I have now showed you the reasonableness of God's
commands, and the unreasonableness of wicked men's
disobedience. If nothing will serve their turn, but
men will yet refuse to turn, we are next to consider,
who is in fault if they be damned. And this brings
me to the last doctrine ; which is,

DOCTRINE VII.

That if after all this men will not turn, it is not the
fault of God that they are condemned, but their
own, even tJieir men wilfidness. They die be-
cause they will, that is, because they will not turn.
If you will go to hell, what remedy '? God here ac-
quits himself of your blood ; it shall not lie on him if
you be lost. A negligent minister may draw it upon
him; and those that encourage you or hinder you
not in sin, may draw it upon them ; but be sure of it,
it shall not lie upon God. Saith the Lord, concern-

ing his unprofitable vineyard : (Isa. 5 : 1, 4,) " Judge,
I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard : what
could have been done more to my vineyard that I
have not done in it '?" When he had planted it in a
fruitful soil, and fenced it, and gathered out the stones,
and planted it with the choicest vines, w T hat should ne
have done more to it 1 He hath made yci men, and
endowed you with reason; he hath furnished you with
all external necessaries ; all creatures are at your ser-
vice; he hath given you a righteous perfect law.
When ye had broken it, and undone yourselves, he
had pity on you, and sent his Son by a miracle of
condescending mercy to die for you, and be a sacrifice
for your sins ; and he was in Christ reconciling the
world to himself!

The Lord Jesus hath made you a deed of gift of
himself, and eternal life with him, on the condition
you will but accept it, and return. He hath on this
reasonable condition offered you the free pardon of all
your sins ! he hath written this in his word, and sealed
it by his Spirit, and sent it by his ministers : they
have made the offer to you a hundred and a hundred
times, and called you to accept it, and to turn to God.
They have in his name entreated you, and reasoned
the case with you, and answered all your frivolous
objections. He hath long waited on you, and staid
your leisure, and suffered you to abuse him to his
face ! He hath mercifully sustained you in the midst
of your sins; he hath compassed you about with all
sorts of mercies ; he hath also intermixed afflictions,
to remind you of your folly, and call you to your
senses, and his Spirit has been often striving w r ith
your hearts, and saying there, " Turn, sinner, turn
to him that calleth thee : Whither art thou going?

What art thou doing 1 Dost thou know what will be
the end 7 How long wilt thou hate thy friends, and
love thine enemies 1 When wilt thou let go all, and
turn and deliver thyself to God, and give thy Re-
deemer the possession of thy soul 1 When shall it
once be?" These pleadings have been used with
thee, and when thou hast delayed, thou hast been
urged to make haste, and God hath called to thee,
" To-day, while it is called to-day, harden not thy
heart." Why not now without any more delay?
Life hath been set before you ; the joys of heaven
have been opened to you in the Gospel ; the certainty
of them hath been manifested; the certainty of the
everlasting torments of the damned hath been de-
clared to you ; unless you would have had a sight of
heaven and hell, what could you desire more ? Christ
hath been, as it were, set forth crucified before your
eyes. Gal. 3:1. You have been a hundred times
told that you are but lost men till you come unto him ;
as oft you have been told of the evil of sin, of the
vanity of sin, the world, and all the pleasures and
wealth it can afford ; of the shortness and uncertainty
of your lives, and the endless duration of the joy or
torment of the life to come. All this, and more than
this have you been told, and told again, even till you
were weary of hearing it, and till you could make
the lighter of it, because you had so often heard it,
like the smith's dog, that is bi ought by custom to
sleep under the noise of the hammers and when the
sparks fly about his ears ; and though all this have
not converted you, yet you are alive, and might have
mercy to this day, if you had but hearts to entertain
it. And now let reason itself be the judge, whether il
be the fault of God or yours, if alter this you will be

unconverted and be damned. If you die now, it is
because you will die. What should be said more to
you, or what course should be taken that is moie like-
ly to prevail 1 Are you able to say, and make it good,
y We would fain have been converted and become new
creatures, but we could not ; we would fain have for-
saken our sins, but we could not; we would have
changed our company, and our thoughts, and our dis-
course, but we could not." Why could you not, if you
would 1 What hindered you but the wickedness of
your hearts ? Who forced you to sin, or who held you
back from duty ? Had not you the same teaching,
and time, and liberty to be godly, as your godly neigh-
bors had ? Why then could not you have been godly
as well as they ? Were the church doors shut against
you, or did you not keep away yourselves, or sit and
sleep, or hear as if you did not hear % Did God put in
any exceptions against you in his word, when he in-
vited sinners to return ; and when he promised mercy
to those that do return ? Did he say, " I will pardon
all that repent except thee ?" Did he shut thee out
from the liberty of his holy worship ? Did he forbid
you to pray to him any more than others ? You know
he did not. God did not drive you away from him,
but you forsook him, and ran away yourselves, and
when he called you to him, you would not come. If
God had excepted you out of the general promise and
offer of mercy, or had said to you, " Stand off, I will
have nothing to do with such as you ; pray not to me,
for I will not hear you ; if you repent never so much,
and cry for mercy never so much, I will not regard
you." If God had left you nothing to trust to but des-
peration, then you had had a fair excuse ; you might
have said, " To what end do I repent and turn, when

it will do no good ?" But this was not your case : you
might have had Christ to be your Lord and Savior,
your head and husband, as well as others, and you
would not, because you felt yourselves not sick enough
for the physician : and because you could not spare
your disease. In your hearts you said as those rebels,
Luke. 19 : 14, " We will not have this man to reign
over us." Christ would have gathered you under
the wings of his salvation, and you would not. Matt.
23 : 37. What desires of your welfare did the Lord
express in his holy word? With what compassion
did he stand over you, and say, " O that my people
had hearkened unto me, and that they had walked in
my ways!" Psalm 17 : 13; 76 : 13, u O that there
were such a heart in this people, that they would fear
me, and keep all my commandments always, that it
might be well with them and with their children for
ever !" Deut. 5 : 29, " O that they were wise, that
they understood this, that they would consider their
latter end !" Deut. 32 : 29. He would have been your
God, and done all for you that your souls could well
desire : but you loved the world and your flesh above
him, and therefore you would not hearken to him :
though you complimented him, and gave him high
titles ; yet when it came to the closing, you would
have none of him. Psalm 81 : 11, 12. No marvel then
if he gave you up to your own hearts' lusts, and you
walked in your own «ounsels. He condescends to rea-
son, and pleads the case with you, and asks you,
" What is there in me, or my service, that you should
be so much against me ? What harm have 1 done
thee, sinner? Have I deserved this unkind dealing at
thy hand? Many mercies have I showed thee: for
which of them dost thou thus despise mc ? Is it I, or

is it satan, that is thy enemy? Is it I, or is it thy
carnal self that would undo thee ? Is it a holy life,
or a life of sin that thou hast cause to fiy from ? If
thou be undone, thou procurest this to thyself, by for-
saking me, the Lord that would have saved thee."
Jer. 2:7. " Doth not thy own wickedness correct
thee, and thy sin reprove thee ? Thou mayest see that
it is an evil and bitter thing that thou hast forsaken
me." Jer. 2 : 19. " What iniquity have you found
in me that you have followed after vanity, and for-
saken me ?" Jer. 2 : 5, 6. He calleth out, as it were,
to the brutes, to hear the controversy he hath against
you. Mic. 2 : 3, 5, " Hear, O ye mountains, the Lord's
controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth ;
for the Lord hath a controversy with his people, and
he will plead with Israel. O my people, what have
I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee ?
testify against me, for I brought thee up out of Egypt,
and redeemed tliee." " Hear, O heavens, and give
ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have nou-
rished and brought up children, and they have rebell-
ed against me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the
ass his master's crib ; but Israel doth not know, my
people doth not consider ! Ah smful nation, a people
laden with iniquity, a seed of evil doers !" &c. Isaiah,
1 : 2, 4. " Do you thus requite the Lord, O foolish
people, and unwise? Is not he thy Father that bought
thee? Hath he not made thee, and established thee?"
Deut. 32 : 6. When he saw that you forsook him,
even for nothing, and turned away from the Lord of
life to hunt after the chaff and feathers of the world,
he told you of your folly, and called you to a more
profitable employment, Isaiah, 55 : 1, 3. " Where-
fore do ye spend your money for that which is not

bread, and your labor for that which satistieth not?
Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is
good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. In-
cline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your
eoul shall live ; and I will make an everlasting cove-
nant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
Seek ye the Lord while he may be found : call ye
upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake
his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and
let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy
upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
pardon;" and so Isa. 1 : 16 — 18. And when you would
not hear, what complaints have you put him to, charg-
ing it on you as your wilfulness and stubbornness.
Jer. 2 : 13, 13. " Be astonished. O heavens, at this,
and be horribly afraid; for my people have committed
two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of
living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken
cisterns, that can hold no water." Many a time halh
Christ proclaimed that free invitation to you, Rev.
22 : 17, " Let him that is athirst come, and whosoever
will, let him take the water of life freely." But you
put him to complain, after all his offers, " They will
not come to me, that they may have life." John, 5 :
40. He hath invited you to feast with him in the
kingdom of his grace, and you have had excuses
from your grounds, and )''our cattle, and your worldly
business ; and when you would not come, you have
said you could not, and provoked him to resolve that
you should never taste of his supper. Luke, 14 : 16 —
25. And who is it the fault of now but yourselves ?
and what can you say is the chief cause of your dam-
nation but your own wills'? you would be damned
The whole case is laid open by Christ himself. Prov.

1 : 20 — 33. " Wisdom crieth without, she uttereth her
voice ia the streets ; she crieth in the chief place of
concourse — How long, ye simple ones, will ye love
simplicity, and the scorners delight in their scorning,
and fools hate knowledge ? Turn ye at my reproof.
Behold, I will pour out my Spirit upon you, I will
make known my words unto you. Because I have
called, and ye refused. I have stretched out my
hands and no man regarded; but ye have set at
naught all my counsels, and would none of my re-
proofs. I also will laugh at your calamity, I will
mock when your fear cometh : when your fear cometh
as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirl-
wind ; when distress and anguish cometh upon you,
then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer ;
they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me,
for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the
fear of the Lord. They would none of my counsels ;
they despised all my reproofs; therefore shall they eat
of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their
own devices. For the turning away of the simple
shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall de-
stroy them. But whoso hearkeneth to me shall dwell
safely, and shall be quiet from tire fear of evil." I
thought best to recite the whole text at large to you,
because it doth so fully show the cause of the destruc-
tion of the wicked. It is not because God would not
teach them, but because they would not learn. It is
not because God would not call them, but because
they would not turn at Ins reproof. Their wilfulness
is their undoing.

Use, — From what hath been said, you may further
»earn these following things :

1. From hence you may see, not only what bla&-



phemy and impiety it is to lay the blame of men's
destruction upon God. but also how unfit these wicked
wretches aro to oring in sucn a charge against their
Maker ! They cry out upon God. and say he gives
them not grace, and his threatenings are severe, and
God forbid that all should be condemned that be not
converted and sanctified; and they think it hard
measure that a short sin should have an endless suf-
fering; and if they be damned they say they cannot
help it, when, in the meantime, they are busy about
their own destruction, even the destruction of their
own souls, and will not be persuaded to hold their
hands. They think God were cruel if he should con-
demn them, and yet they are so cruel to themselves
that they will run into the fire of hell, when God hath
told them it is a little before them; and neither en-
treaties, nor threatenings, nor any thing that can be
said, will stop them. We see them almost undone;
their careless, worldly, fleshly lives, tell us that they
are in the power of the devil ; we know, if they die
before they are converted, all the world cannot save
them; and knowing the uncertainty of their lives, we
are afraid every day lest they drop into the fire; and
therefore we entreat them to pity their own souls, and
not to undo themselves when mercy is at hand, and
they will not hear us. We entreat them to cast away
their sin, and come to Christ without delay, and to
have some mercy on themselves, but they will have
none; and yet they think that God must be cruel if
he condemn them. O wilful miserable sinners ! it is
not God that is cruel to you, it is you that are cruel
to yourselves; you are told you must turn or burn,
and yet you turn not. You are told, that if you will
needs keep your sins, you shall keep the curse of God



Doet.7. THE UNCONVERTED. 131

with them, and yet you will keep them. You are told
that there is no way to happiness but by holiness, and
vet you will not be holy. What would you have God
eay more to you ? What would you have him do with
his mercy? He offereth it to you, and you will not
have it. You are in the ditch of sin and misery, and
he would give you his hand to help you out, and you
refuse his help ; he would cleanse you of your sins,
and you had rather keep them ; you love your lust,
and love your gluttony, and sports, and drunkenness,
and will not let them go ; would you have him bring
you to heaven whether you will or not ?■ Or would
you have him bring you and your sins to heaven
together ? Why that is an impossibility : you may as
well expect he should turn the sun into darkness.
What! an unsanctified fleshly heart be in heaven?
it cannot be. There entereth nothing that is unclean.
Rev. 21 : 17. " For what communion hath light with
darkness, or Christ with Belial?" 2 Cor. 6 : 14, 15.
" All the day long hath he stretched out his hands to
a disobedient and gainsaying people." Rom. 10 : 21.
What will you do now ? Will you cry to God for
mercy? Why, God calleth upon you to have mercy
upon yourselves, and you will not ! Ministers see the
poisoned cup in the drunkard's hand, and tell him
there is poison in it, and desire him to have mercy on
his soul, and forbear, and he will not hear us ! Drink
it he must and will ; he loves it, and, therefore, though
hell comes next, he saith he cannot help it. What
should one say to such men as these? We tell the
ungodly careless worldling, it is not such a life that
will serve the turn, or ever bring you to heaven. If
a lion were at your back you would mend your pace ;
when the curse of God is at vour back, and satan



132 A CALL TO Doet. 7

and hell are at your back, will you not stir, but
ask, What needs of all this ado? Is an immortal
soul of no more worth ? O have mercy upon your-
selves! But they will have no mercy on them-
selves, nor once regard us. We tell them the end will
be bitter. Who can dwell with the everlasting fire 1
And yet they will have no mercy on themselves.
And yet will these shameless transgressors say, that
God is more merciful than to condemn them, when it
is themselves that cruelly and unmercifully run upon
condemnation ; and if we should go to them, and en-
treat them, we cannot stop them ; if we should fall
on our knees to them we cannot stop them, but to hell
they will go, and yet will not believe that they are
going thither. If we beg of them for the sake of God
that made them, and preserveth them ; for the sake
of Christ that died for them; for the sake of their
own souls to pity themselves, and go no further in the
way to hell, but come to Christ while his arms are
open, and enter into the state of life while the door
stands open, and now take mercy while mercy may
be had, they will not be persuaded. If we should
die for it, we cannot so much as get them now and
then to consider with themselves of the matter, and
turn; and yet they can say, " I hope God will be
merciful." Did you never consider what he saith,
Isa. 27 : 11, " It is a people of no understanding;
therefore, he that made them will not have mercy on
them, and he that formed them will show them no
favor." If another man will not clothe you when
you are naked, and feed you when you are hungry,
you will say he is unmerciful. If he should cast you
into prison, or beat and torment you, you would say
he is unmerciful: and yet you will do a thousand



Doct. 7. TnE UNCONVERTED. 133

limce more against yourselves, even cast away both
soul and body for ever, and never complain of your
own unmereilulness ! Yea, and God that waited upon
you all the while with his mercy, must be taken to
be unmerciful, if he punish you after all this. Unless
the holy God of heaven will give these wretches
leave to trample upon his Son's blood, and with the
Jews, as it were, again to spit in his face, and do des-
pite to the spirit of grace, and make a jest of sin. and
a mock at holiness, and set more light by saving
mercy than by the filth of their fleshly pleasures; and
unless, alter all this, he will save them by the mercy
which they cast away, and would have none of, God
himself must be called unmerciful by them ! But he
w T ill be justified when he judgeth, and he will not
stand or fail at the bar of a sinful worm.

I know there are many particular cavils that are
brought by them against the Lord ; but I shall not
here stay to answer them particularly, having done
it already in my Treatise of Judgment, to which I
shall refer them. Had the disputing part of the world
been as careful to avoid sin and destruction as they
have been busy in searching after the cause of them,
and forward indirectly to impute them to God, they
might have exercised their wits more profitably, and
have less wronged God, and sped better themselves.
When so ugly a monster as sin is within us, and so
heavy a thing as punishment is on us, and so dreadful
a thing as hell is before us, one would think it should
be an easy question who is in the fault ; whether God
or man be the principal or culpable cause? Some
men are such favorable judges of themselves, that
they are more prone to accuse the infinite perfection
and goodness itself, than their own hearts, and imitate

Dax. Call. jo



134 A CALL TO Doct. 7

their first parents, that said, " The serpent tempted
me ; and the woman that thou gavest me gave unto
me, and I did eat ;" secretly implying that God was
the cause. So say they, " The understanding that
thou gavest me was unable to discern ; the will that
thou gavest me was unable to make a better choice ;
the objects which thou didst set before me did entice
me ; the temptations which thou didst permit to assault
me prevailed against me." And some are so loth to
think that God can make a self-determining creature,
that they dare not deny him that which they take to
be his prerogative, to be the determiner of the will in
every sin, as the first efficient immediate physical
cause ; and many could be content to acquit God from
so much causing of evil, if they could but reconcile it
with his being the chief cause of good ; as if truths
would be no longer truths than we are able to see
them ii? their perfect order and coherence ; because
our ravelled wits cannot see them right together, nor
assign each truth its proper place, we presume to con-
clude that some must be cast away. This is the fruit
of proud self-conceitedness, when men receive not
God's truth as a child his lesson, in holy submission to
the omniscience of our Teacher but as censurers that
are too wise to learn.

Objection. But we cannot convert ourselves till
God convert us; we can do nothing without his
grace ; it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that
runneth, but in God that showeth mercy.

Answ. 1. God hath two degrees of mercy to show;
the mercy of conversion first, and the mercy of salva-
tion last ; the latter he will give to none but those
that will and run, and hath promised it to them only.
The former is to make them willing that are unwJ-



Ooct 7. THE UNCONVERTED. 135

ling ; and though your own willingness and endeavors
deserve not his grace, yet your wilful refusal deserveth
that it should be denied to yon. Your disability ia
your very unwillingness itself, which excuseth not
your sin, but maketh it the greater. You could turn
if you were bat truly willing ; and if your wills them-
selves are so corrupted that nothing but effectual grace
will move them, you have the more cause to seek for
that grace, and yield to it, and do what you can in
the use of means, and not neglect it and set yourself
against it. Do what you are able first, and then com-
plain of God for denying you grace, if you have
cause.

Object. But you seem to intimate all this while
that man hath free will.

Atisid. 1. The dispute about free will is beyond
your capacity ; I shall, therefore, now trouble you with
no more but this about it. Your will is naturally a free,
that is, a self-determining faculty ; but it is viciously
inclined, and backward to do good ; and therefore we
see, by sad experience, that it hath not a virtuous
moral freedom ; but that it is the wickedness of it
which procures the punishment ; and I pray you let
us not befool ourselves with opinions. Let the case be
your own. If you had an enemy that was so mali-
cious as to fall upon you and beat you, or take away
the lives of your children, would you excuse him be-
cause he said I have not free will ; it is my nature, 1
cannot choose unless God give me grace? If you had
a servant that robbed you, would you take such an
answer from him ? Might not every thief and mur-
derer that is hanged at the assize give such an an-
swer: I have not free will; I cannot change my own
heart; what can I do without God's grace? and shall



136 A CALL TO Dort- 7

they therefore be acquitted? If not, why then should
you think to be acquitted for a course of sin against
the Lord?

2. From hence also you may observe these throa
things together: — 1. What a subtle tempter Satan is.
2. What a deceitful thing sin is. 3. What a foolish
creature corrupted man is. A subtle tempter, indeed,
that can persuade the greatest part of the world tc
go into everlasting fire, when they have so many
warnings and dissuasives as they have ! A deceilfin
thing is sin, indeed, that can bewitch so many thou-
sands to part with everlasting life for a thing so base
and utterly unworthy ! A foolish creature is man, in-
deed, that will be cheated of his salvation for nothing
yea, for a known nothing; and that by an enemy, and
a known enemy. You would think it impossible that
any man in his wits should be persuaded for a little to
cast himself into the fire, or water, or into a coal-pit,
to the destruction of his life ; and yet men will be
enticed to cast themselves into hell. If your natural
lives were in your own hands, that you should not die
till you would kill yourselves, how long would most
of you live ? And yet, when your everlasting life is so
far in your own hands, under God, that you cannot
be undone till you undo yourselves, how lew of you
will forbear your own undoing? Ah, what a silly
thing is man ! and what a bewitching and befooling
thing is sin !

3. From hence, also, you may learn, that it is no
great wonder if wicked men be hinderers of others in
the way to heaven, and would have as many uncon-
verted as they can, and would draw them into sin
and keep them in it. Can you expect that they
should have mercy on others, that have none upoc



Doct. 7 THE UNCONVERTED. 137

themselves? and that they should hesitate much at
the destruction of others, that hesitate not to destroy
themselves? They do no worse by others than they
do by themselves.

4. Lastly, You may hence learn that the greatest
enemy to man is himself; and the greatest judgment
in this liie that can befall him, is to be left to him-
self; that the great work that grace hath to do, is tu
save us from ourselves ; that the greatest accusations
and complaints of men should be against themselves,
that the greatest work that we have to do ourselves,
is to resist ourselves ; and the greatest enemy that
we should daily pray, and watch, and strive against,
is our own carnal hearts and wills ; and the greatest
part of your work, if you would do good to others, and
help them to heaven, is to save them from them-
selves, even from their blind understandings, and
corrupted wills, and perverse affections, and violent
passions, and unruly senses. I only name all these
for brevity's sake, and leave them to your fufther
consideration.

Well, sirs, now we have found out the great delin-
quent and murderer of souls, (even men's selves, their
own wills.) what remains but that you judge accord-
ing to the evidence, and confess this great iniquity
before the Lord, and be humbled for it, and do so no
more ? To these three ends distinctly, I shall add a
few words more. 1. Further to convince you. 2. To
humble you. And, 3. To reform you, if there yet
be any hope.

1. We know so much of the exceeding gracious

nature of God, who is willing to do good, and de-

lighteth to show mercy, that we have no reason to

suspect him of being the culpable cause of our death,

12*



138 A CALL TO Doct. *

or to call him cruel ; he made all good, and he pre-
serveth and maintaineth all ; the eyes of all wait
upon him, and he giveth them their meat in due
season: he openeth his hand, and satisfied! the de-
sires olall the living. Psalm 145 : 15, 16. He is not
only righteous in all his ways, and therefore will deal
justly ; and holy in all his works, and therefore not
the. author of sin, but he is also good to all, and his
tender mercies are over all his works. Psalm 145 :
17, 19.

But as for man, we know his mind is dark, his will
perverse, and his affections carry him so headlong,
that he is fitted by his folly and corruption to such a
work as the destroying of himself. II" you saw a
lamb lie killed in the way, would you sooner suspect
the sheep, or the wolf to be the author of it, if they
both stand by? Or if you see a house broken open,
and the people murdered, would you sooner suspect
the prince or judge, that is wise and just, and had no
need,' or a known thief or murderer ? I say, therefore,
as James, 1 : 13 — 15, " Let no man say, when he is
tempted, that he is tempted of God, for God cannot
be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man,
(to draw him to sin,) but every man is tempted when
he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed. Then
when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin ; and
sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death." You
see here that sin is the offspring of your own concu-
piscence, and not to be charged on God ; and that
death is the offspring of your own sin, and the fruit
which it will yield you as soon as it is ripe. You
have a treasure of evil in yourselves, as a spider hath
of poison, from whence you are bringing forth hurt
to yourselves, and spinning such webs as entangle



Doct. 7. THE UNCONVERTED. 139

your own souls. Your nature shows it is you that arc
the cause.

2. It is evident that, you are your own destroyers,
in that you are so ready to entertain any temptation
almost that is offered to you, Satan is scarcely more
ready to move you to any evil, than you are ready
to hear, and to do as he would have you. If he would
tempt your understanding to error and prejudice, you
yield. If he would hinder you from good resolutions,
it is soon done. If he would cool any good desires or
affections, it is soon done. If lie would kindle any
lust, or vile affections and desires in you, it is soon
done. If he will put you on to evil thoughts, or deeds,
you are so free that he needs no rod or spur. If he
would keep you from holy thoughts, and words, and
ways, a little doth it, you need no curb. You examine
not his suggestion?, nor resist them with any resolu-
tion, nor cast them out as he casts them in, nor quench
the sparks which he endeavoreth to kindle. ; but you
set in with him, and meet him half way, and em-
brace his motions, and tempt him to tempt yon. And
it is easy for him to catch such greedy fish that are
ranging for a bait, and will take the bare hook.

3. Your destruction is evidently of yourselves, in that
you resist all that would help to save you, and would
do you good, or hinder you from undoing yourselves.
God would help and save you by his word, and you
resist it; it is Loo strict for you. He would sanctify
you by his Spirit, and you resist and quench it. If
any man reprove you for your sin, you By in his face
with evil Avords ; and if he would draw you to a holy
life, and tell you of your present danger, you give
him little thanks, but either bid him look to himself,
he shall not answer for you ; or at best you nut him oil



140 A CALL TO Doct. 7

with heartless thanks, and wiii not turn when you are
persuaded. If ministers would privately instruct and
help you, you will not come to them ; your unhumbled
(souls feel but little need of their help ; if they would
catechise you, you are too old to be catechised, though
you are not too old to be ignorant and unholy. What
ever they can say to you for your good, you are so
self-conceited and wise in your own eyes, even in the
depth of ignorance, that you will regard nothing that
agreeth not with your present conceits, but contradict
your teachers, as if you were wiser than they ; you
resist all that they can say to you, by your ignorance,
and wilfulness, and foolish cavils, and shifting eva-
sions, and unthankful rejections, so that no good that
is offered can find any welcome acceptance and enter-
tainment with you.

4. Moreover, it is apparent that you are self-de-
stroyers, in that you " draw the matter of your sin
and destruction even from the blessed God himself.''
You like not the contrivances of his wisdom ; you
Like not his justice, but take it for cruelty ; you like-
not his holiness, but are ready to think he is such a
one as yourselves, (Psalm 1 : 21,) and makes as 1 ght
of sin as you do; you like not his truth, but would
have his threatening?, even his peremptory threaten-
ings, prove false ; and his goodness, which you seem
rxjost highly to approve, you partly resist, as it would
lead you to repentance; and partly abuse, to the
strengthening of your sin, as if you might more free-
ly sin because God is merciful, and because his grace
doth so much abound.

5. Yea, you fetch destruction from the blessed Re-
deemer, and death from the Lord of life himself! and
nothing more emboldeneth you in sin, than that



Doct. 7. THE UNCONVERTED. 141

Christ hath died for you ; as if now the danger of
death were over, and you might boldly venture ; a&
if Christ were become a servant to satan and your
sins, and must wait upon you while you are abusing
him ; and because he is become the Physician ot'souls,
and is able to save to the uttermost all that come to
God by him, you think he must suffer you to refuse
his help, and throw away his medicines, and must
save you whether you will come to God by him or
not: so that a great port of your sins are occasioned
by your bold presumption upon the death of Christ,
not considering that he came to redeem his people
from their sins, and to sanctify them a peculiar people
to himself j and to conform them in holiness to the
image of their heavenly Father, and to their head.
Matt. 1 : 21 ; Tit 2 : 14 ; 1 Pet. 1 : 15, 16 ; Col. 3 : 10,
11; Phil. 3:9, 10.

6, You also fetch your own destruction from all the
providences and works of God. When you think cf
his eternal fore-knowledge and decrees, it is to harden
you in your sin, or possess your minds with quarrel-
ling thoughts, as if his decrees might spare you the
labor of repentance and a holy life, or else were the
cause of sin and death. If he afflict you, you repine;
if he prosper you, you the more forget him, and are
the more backward to the thoughts of the life to come.
If the wicked prosper, you forget the end thai will set
all reckonings straight, and are ready to think it is as
good to be wicked as godly ; and thus you draw your
death from all.

7. And the like you do fiom all the creatures and
mercies of God to you. He giveth them to you as
the tokens of his love and furniture for his service,
and you turn them against him, to the pleasing of



142 A CALL TO Doct. 7

year flesh. You eat and drink to please your appe-
tite, and not for the glory of God, and to enable you
to perform his work. Your clothes you abuse to
pride ; your riches draw your hearts from heaven ;
(Phil. 3 : 18;) your honors and applause .puff you up ;
if you have health and strength, it makes you more
secure, and forget your ena. Yea, other men's mercies
are abused by you to your hurt. If you see their ho-
nors and dignity, you are provoked to envy them ; if
you see their riches, you are ready to covet them ; if
you look upon beauty, you are stirred up to lust ; and
it is well if godliness itself be not an eye-sore to you.

8. The very gifts that God bestoweth on you, and
the ordinances of grace winch he hath instituted for
his church, you turn to sin. If you have better parts
than others, you grow proud and self-conceited ; if you
have but common gifts, you take them for special
grace. You take the bare hearing of your duty for
so good a work, as if it would excuse you for not obey-
ing it. Your prayers are turned into sin, because you
(i regard iniquity in your hearts," (Psalm 66 : 18,)
and depart not from iniquity when you call on the
name of the Lord. 2 Tim. 2 : 19. Your " prayere
are abominable, because you turn away your ear
from hearing the law," (Prov. 28 : 9,) and are more
ready to offer the sacrifice of fools, thinking you do
God some special service, than to hear his word and
obey it. Eccles. 5:1.

9. Yea, the persons that you converse with, and all
their actions, you make the occasions of your sin and
destruction. If they live in the fear of God, you hate
them. If they live ungodly, you imitate them ; if the
wicked are many, you think you may the more boldly
follow them ; if the godly be few, you are the more



Doet. 7. THE UNCONVERTED. 143

emboldened to despise them. If they walk exactly,
you think they are too precise ; if one of them fall in
a particular temptation you stumble and turn away
from holiness because that others are imperfectly
holy ; as if you were warranted to break yout ^fie^a
because some others have by their heedlessness [strata*
ed a sinew, or put out a bone. If a hypocrite discover
himself, you say, " They arc all alike," and think
yourselves as honest as the best. A professor can
scarce slip into any miscarriage, but because he cuts
his finger you think you may boldly cut your tl iroats.
If ministers deal plainly with you, you say they rail.
If they speak gently or coldly, you either sleep under
them, or are little more affected than the seats you
sit upon. If any errors creep into the church, some
greedily entertain them, and others reproach the
Christian doctrine for them, which is most against
them. And if we would draw you from any ancient
rooted error, which can but plead two, or three, or six,
or seven hundred years' custom, you are as much
offended with a motion for reformation as if you were
to lose your life by it, and hold fast old errors, while
you cry out against new ones. Scarce a difference
can arise among the ministers of the Gospel, but you
will fetch your own death from it ; and you will not
hear, or at least not obey, the unquestionable doctrine
of any of those that agree not with your conceits. One
vviil not hear a minister because he saith the Lord's
prayer ; and another will not hear him because he
doth not use it. One will not hear them that are for
episcopacy ; and another will not hear them that are
against it. And thus I might show it you in many
other cases, how you turn all that comes near you 10
your own destruction ; so clear is it that the ungodly



144 A CALL TO Doct. 7.

are self- destroyers, and that their perdition is of
themselves.

Methinks now, upon the consideration of what is
said, and the review of your own ways, you should
bethink you what you have done, and be ashamed
and deeply humbled to remember it. If you be not, I
pray you consider these following truths :

1. To be your own destroyers is to sin against the
deepest principle in your natures, even the principle
of self-preservation. Every thing naturally desireth
or inclineth to its own felicity, welfare, or perfection,
and will you set yourselves to your own destruction?
When you are commanded to love your neighbors as
yourselves, it is supposed that you naturally love your-
selves; but if you love your neighbors no better than
yourselves, it seems you would have all the world to
be damned.

2. How extremely do you cross ycur own inten-
tions ! 1 know you intend not your own damnation,
even when you arc procuring it ; you think you are
but doing good to yourselves, by gratifying the de-
sires of your flesh. But, alas, it is but as a draught
of cold water in a burning lever, or as the scratching
cf an itching wild-fire, which incrcaseth the disease
and pain. If indeed you would have pleasure, profit,
or honor, seek them where they are to be found, and
do not hunt after them in the way to hell.

3. What pity is it that you should do that against
yourselves which none else on earth or in hell can do!
If all the world were combined against you, or all the
devils in hell were combined against you, they could
not destroy you without yourselves, nor make you sin
but by your own consent : and will you do that against
yourselves which no one else can do ? You have hate-



Doc«- 7 THE UNCONVERTED. 145

ful thoughts of the devil, because he is your enemy,
and endeavoreth your destruction ; and will you be
worse than devils to yourselves 7 Why thus it is with
you, if you had hearts to understand it : when you
run into sin, and run from godliness, and refuse to
turn at the call of God, you do more against your own
souls than men or devils could do besides ; and if you
should set yourselves and bend your wits to do your-
selves the greatest mischief, you could not devise to
do a greater.

4. You are false to the trust that God hath reposed
in you. He hath much intrusted you with your own
salvation ; and will you betray your trust ? He hath
e.et you, with all diligence, to keep your hearts ; and
is this the keeping of them ? Prov. 4 : 23.

5. You do even forbid all others to pity you, when
you will have no pity on yourselves. If you cry to
God in the day of your calamity for mercy, mercy ;
what can you expect, but that he should thrust you
away, and say, " Nay, thou wouldst not have mercy
on thyself; who brought this upon thee but thy own
wilfulness V And if your brethren see you everlast-
ingly in misery, how shall they pity you that were
your own destroyers, and would not be dissuaded?

6. It will everlastingly make you your own tor-
mentors in hell, to think that you brought yourselves
wilfully to that misery. O what a piercing thought
it will be for ever to think with yourselves that this
was your own doing ! that you were warned of this
day, and warned again, but it would not do ; that you
wilfully sinned, and wilfully turned away from God !
that you had time as well as others, but you abused

; you had teachers as well as others, but you re-
fused their instruction; you had holy examples, but

Box. CaM. l3



HG A CALL TO DOct 7

you did not imitate them j you were offered Christ,
and grace, and glory, as well as ethers, but you had
more mind of your fleshly pleasures ! you had a price
in your hands, but you had not a heart to lay it out.
Prow 17 : 16. Can it fail to torment you to think ot
this your present folly ? O that your eyes were open
to see what you have done in the wilful wronging ol
your own souls ! and that you better understood these
words of God. Prov. 8 : 33, 30, " Hear instruction
and be wise, and refuse it not. Blessed is the man
that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, wait-
ing at the posts of my doors : for whoso findeth me
findeth life, and shall obtain favor of the Lord. But
he that sinneth against me, wrongeth his own soul.
All they that hate me love death."

And now I am come to the conclusion of this work,
my heart is troubled to think how I shall leave you,
lest after this the flesh should still deceive you, and
the world and the devil should keep you asleep, and I
should leave you as I found you, till you awake in
hyll. Though in care of your poor souls, I am afraid
of this, as knowing the obstinacy of a carnal heart;
yet I can say with the prophet Jeremiah, (17 : 10,)
"I have not desired the woful day, thou Lord know-
est." 1 have not, with James and John, desired thai
" fire might come from heaven" to consume them that
refused Jesus Christ. Luke, 9 : 54. But it is the pre-
venting of the eternal fire that 1 have been all this
while endeavoring : and O tlvat it had been a need-
less work ! That God and conscience might have
been as willing to spare me this labor as some of you
couid have been. Dear friends, I am so loth that you
should he in everlasting fire, and be shut out of hea-



DoctT. T UE UNCONVERTED. 147

ven, if it be possible to prevent it, that I shall once
more ask you, what do you now resolve ? Will you
turn, or die ? I look upon you as a physician on his
patient, in a dangerous disease, that saith to him,
*' Tbcugli you are far gone, take but this medicine,
and forbear but those lew things that are hurtful to
you, and I dare warrant your life; but if you will not
do this you are but a dead man." "What would you
think of such a man, if the physician, and all the
friends he hath, cannot persuade him to take one me-
dicine to save his life, or to forbear one or two poison-
ous things that would kill him? This is your case.
As lar as you are gone in sin, do but now turn and
come to Christ, and take his remedies, and your souls
shall live. Cast up your deadly sins by repentance,
and return not to the poisonous vomit any more, and
you shall do well. But yet, if it were your bodies
that we had to deal with, we might partly know
what to do for you. Though you would not consent,
yet you might be held or bound while the medicine
were poured doAvn your throats, and hurtful things
might be kept from you. But about your souls it can-
not be so ; we cannot convert you against your wills.
There is no carrying madmen to heaven in fetters.
You may be condemned against your wills, because
you sinned with your wills; but you cannot be saved
against your wills. The wisdom of C4od has thought
meet to lay men's salvation or destruction exceed-
ingly much upon the choice of their own will, that
no man shall come to heaven that chose not the way
to heaven; and no man shall come to hell, but shall
be forced to say, " I have the thing I chose, my own
will did bring me hither." Now, if I could but get you
to be willing, to be thoroughly, and resolvedly, and



148 A CALL TO Do"- 7

habitually willing, the work were more than half
done. And alas ! must we lose our friends, and must
they lose their God, their happiness, their souls, for
want of this ? O God forbid ! It is a strange thing
to me that men are so inhuman and stupid in the
greatest matters, who in lesser things are civil and
courteous, and good neighbors. For aught I know, I
have the love of all, or almost all my neighbors, so
far, that if I should send to any man in the town, or
parish, or country, and request a reasonable courtesy
of them, they would grant it me ; and yet when I
come to request of them the greatest matter in the
world, for themselves, and not for me, I can have no-
thing of many of them but a patient hearing. I know
not whether people think a man in the pulpit is in
good earnest or not, and means as he speaks ; for I
think I have few neighbors, but, if I were sitting fa-
miliarly with them, and telling them what I have
seen and done, or known in the world, they them-
selves shall see and know in the world to come, they
would believe me, and regard what I say ; but when
I tell them, from the infallible word of God, what they
themselves shall see and know in the world to come,
they show, by their lives, that they do either not be
lieve it or not much regard it. If I met any one oi
them on the way, and told them yonder is a coal-pit,
or there is a quicksand, or there are thieves lying in
wait for you, I could persuade them to turn by ; but
when I tell them that satan lieth in wait for them,
and that sin is poison to them, and that hell i3 not a
matter to be jested with, they go on as if they did not
hear me. Truly, neighbors, I am in as good earnest
with you hi the pulpit as I am in my familiar die-
course ; and if ever you will regard me, I beseech



Doct 7. THE UNCONVERTED. 149

you let it be here. I think there is not a man of you
all, but, if my own soul lie at your wills, you would
be willing to save it, though I cannot promise that
yoM would leave your sins for it. Tell me, thou
drunkard, art thou so cruel to me, that thou wouldst
not forbear a few cups of drink, if thou knewest :'<t
would save my soul from hell ? Hadst thou rather
that I did burn there for ever than thou shouldst live
eoberly as other men do ? If so, may I not say, thou
art an unmerciful monster, and net a man ? If I came
hungry or naked to one of your doors, would you not
part with moie than a cup of drink to relieve me? I
am confident you would. If it were to save my life,
I know you would, some of you, hazard your own;
and yet will you not be entreated to part with your
sensual pleasures for your own salvation / Wouldst
thou forbear a hundred cups of drink to save my life,
if k were in thy power, and wilt thou not do it to save
thy own soul ? I profess to you, sirs, I am as hearty a
beggar with you this day for the saving of your own
souls, as I would be lor my own supply, if I were
forced to come begging to your doors ; and therefore
if you wou-ld hear me then, hear me now. If you
would pity me then, be entreated now to pity your-
selves. I do again beseech you, as if t were on my
bended knees, that you would hear' en to your Re-
deemer, and turn, that you may Ji- e. Ail you that
have lived in ignorance, and cardessness, and pre-
sumption, to this day; all you that have been drowned
in the cares of the world, and have no mind of God,
and eternal glory; ail you that are enslaved to your
fleshly desires of meats and drinks, sports and lusts;
and all you that know not tlj3 necessity of holiness,
and never Avere acquainted with the sanctifying work
13*



150 A CALL TJ Doct. 7

of the Holy Ghost upon your souls ; that never em-
braced your blessed Redeemer by a lively faith, and
with admiring and thankful apprehensions of his love;
and that never felt a higher estimation of God and
heaven, and heartier love to them than your fleshly
prosperity, and the things below ; I earnestly beseech
you, not only for my sake, but for the Lord's sake,
and for your soul's sake, that you go not one day
longer in your former condition, but look about you,
and cry to God for converting grace, that you may
be made new creatures, and may escape the plagues
that are a little before you. And if ever you will do
any thing for me, grant me this request, to turn from
your evil ways and live. Deny me any thing that
ever I shall ask you for myself, if you will but grant
me this ; and if you deny me this, I care not for any
thing else that you would grant me. Nay, as ever
you will do any thing at the request of the Lord that
made you, and died that you may live, deny him not
this ; for if you deny him this, he cares for nothing
that you shall grant him. As ever you would have
him hear your prayers, and grant your requests, and
do for you at the hour of death and day of judgment,
or in any of your extremities, deny not his request
now in the day of your prosperity. O sirs, believe it,
death and judgment, and heaven and hell, are other
matters when you come near them, than they seem
to carnal eyes af ar off: then you would hear such a
message as I bring you with more awakened regard-
ful hearts.

Well, though I cannot hope so well of all, I will
hope that some of you are by this time purposing to
turn and live ; and that you are ready to ask me, as
the Jews did Peter, (Acts. 2 : 37,) when they were



l*>ct.7. THE UNCONVERTED. 151

pricked in their hearts, and said, " Men and brethren,
what shall we do ?" How may we come to be truly
converted ? We are willing, if we did but know our
duty. God forbid that we should choose destruction
by refusing conversion, as hitherto we have done.

If these be the thoughts and purposes of your
hearts, I Gay of you as God did of a promising peo-
ple, (Deut. 5 : 28, 29,) " They have well said all that
they have spoken : O that there was such a heart in
ihem, that they would fear me, and keep all my
commandments always !" Your purposes are good :
O that there were but a heart in you to perform these
purposes ! And in hope hereof I shall gladly give you
direction what to do, and that but briefly, that you
may the easier remember it for your practice.

Direction I. — If you would be converted and
saved, labor to understand the necessity and true na-
ture of conversion ; for what, and from what, and to
what, and by what it is that you must turn.

Consider in what a lamentable condition you are
till the hour of your conversion, that you may see it
is not a state to be rested in. You are under the guilt
of all the sins that ever you committed, and under
the wrath of God, and the curse of his law ; you are
bond slaves to the devil, and daily employed in his
work against the Lord, yourselves, and others ; you
are spiritually dead and deformed, as being devoid of
the holy life, and nature, and image of the Lord.
You are unfit for any holy work, and do nothing that
is truly pleasing to God. You are without any pro-
mise or assurance of his protection, and live in con-
tinual danger of his justice, not knowing what hour
you may be snatched away to hell, and most certain



152 A CALL TO Doet. 7

to be lost if you die in that condition ; and nothing
short of conversion can prevent it. Whatever civili-
ties or amendments are short of true conversion, will
never procure the saving of your souls. Keep the
true sense of this natural misery, and so cf the neces-
sity of conversion on your hearts.

And then you must understand what it is to be
converted ; it is to have a new heart or disposition,
and a new conversation.

Quest. 1. For what must we turn?

Answ. For these ends following, which you may
attain: 1. You shall immediately be made living
members of Christ, and have an interest in him. and
be renewed after the image of God, and be adorned
with all his graces, and quickened with a new and
heavenly life, and saved from the tyranny of Satan,
and the dominion of si n,and be justified from the curse
of the law, and have the pardon of all the sins oi
your whole lives, and be accepted of God, and made
his sons, and have liberty with boldness to call him
Father, and go to him by prayer in all your needs,
with a promise of acceptance; you shall have the
Holy Ghost to dwell in you, to sanctify and guide
you ; you shall have part in the brotherhood, commu-
nion, and prayers of the saints; you shall be fitted
for God's service, and be freed from the dominion of
sin, and be useful, and a blessing to the place where
you live; and shall have the promise of this life, and
that which is to come: you shall want nothing that
is truly good for you, and your necessary alliictiona
you will be enabled to bear ; you may have seme
taste of communion with God in the Spirit, especially
in all holy ordinances, where God prepareth a feast
tbr your souls ; you shall be heirs of heaven while



Doct. 7. THE UNCONVERTED. 153

you live or earth, and may foresee by faith the ever-
lasting glory, and so may live and die in peace ; and
you shall never be so low but your happiness will be
incomparably greater than your misery.

How precious is every one of these blessings, which
I do but briefly name, and which in this life you may
receive !

And then, 2. At death your souls shall go to Christ,
and at the day of judgment both soul and body shall
be glorified and justified, and enter into your Master's
joy, where your happiness will consist in these par-
ticulars :

1. You shall be perfected yourselves ; your mortal
bodies shall be made immortal, and the corruptible
shall put on incorruption ; you shall no more be hun-
gry, or thirsty, or weary, or sick, nor shall you need
to fear either shame, or sorrow, or death, or hell ; your
souls shall be perfectly freed from sin, and perfectly
fitted for the knowledge, and love, and praises of the
Lord.

2. Your employment shall be to behold your glori-
fied Redeemer, with all your holy fellow citizens of
heaven, and to see the glory of the most blessed God,
and to love him perfectly, and be beloved by him, and
to praise him everlastingly.

3. Your glory will contribute to the glory of the
New Jerusalem, the city of the living God, which is
more than to have a private felicity to yourselves.

4. Your glory will contribute to the glorifying of
your Redeemer, who will everlastingly be magnified
and pleased in that you are the travail of his soul,
and this is more than the glorifying of yourselves.

5. And the eternal Majesty, the living God, wiil
oe glorified in your glory, both as he is magnified by



154 A CALL TO D«x* 1

j^our praises, and as lie communicatelh of liis glory
unci goodness to you, and as he is pleased in you, and
in the accomplishment of his glorious work, in the
glory of the New Jerusalem, and of his Son.

All this the poorest beggar of you that is converted
shall certainly and endlessly enjoy.

II. You see for what you must turn : next you
must understand from what you must turn ; and thij
is, in a word, from your carnal self, which is the end
of all the unconverted : — from the flesh that would be
pleased before God, and would still be enticing you ; —
from the world, that is the bait ; and from the devil,
that is the angler for souls, and the deceiver. And so
from all known and wilful sins.

III. Next you must know to what end you must
turn ; and that is, to Gcd as your end ; to Christ as
the way to the Father; to holiness as the way ap-
pointed you by Christ: and to the use of all the helps
and means of grace afforded you by the Lord.

IV. Lastly; you must know by what you must
turn ; and that is by Christ, as the only Redeemer
and Intercessor; and by the Holy Ghost, as the
Sanctifier; and by the word, as Ids instrument or
means; and by faith and repentance, as the means
and duties on your part to be performed. All this ia
of necessity.

Direction II. — If you will be converted and saved,
be much in serious secret consideration. Inconside-
rareness undoes the world. Withdraw yourselves olt
into retired secrecy-, and there bethink you of the
end why you were made, of the life you have lived,
of the rime you have lost, the sins you have commit-
ted ; of the love, and sufferings, and fulnesc of Christ ;



Pod. 7. THE UNCONVERTED. ,55

ol the danger you are in ; of the nearness of dcaih
and judgment j of the certainty and excellency of the
joys of heaven ; and of the certainty and terror of the
torments of hell, and the eternity of both; and of the
necessity of conversion and a holy life. Absorb your
hearts in such considerations as these.

Direction III. — If you will be converted and saved,
attend upon the word of God, which is the ordinary
means. Read the Scripture, or hear it read, and
other holy writings that do apply it j constantly
attend on the public preaching of the word. As God
will light the world by the sun, and not by himself
without it, so will he convert and save men by hia
ministers, who are the lights of the world. Acts,
m : 17, 13. Matt. 5 : 14. When he had miraculously
humbled Paul, he sent Ananias to him, (Acts, 9 : 10,)
and when he had sent an angel to Cornelius, it was
but to bid him send lor Peter, who must tell him what
to believe and do.

Direction IV.— Betake yourselves to God in a
course of earnest constant prayer. Confess and la-
ment your former lives, and beg his grace to illuminate
and convert you. Beseech him to pardon what is past,
and to give you his Spirit, and change your hearts
and lives, and lead you in his ways, and save you
from temptation. Pursue this work daily, and be not
weary of it.

Direction V. — Presently give over your known
and wilful sins. Make a stand, and go that way no
farther. Be drunk no more, but avoid the very occa-
sion of it. Cast away your lusts and sinful pleasures



156 A CALL TO l**l '

with detestation. Curse, and swear, and rail no more;
and if you have wronged any, restore, as Zaccheus
did; if you will commit again your old sins, what
blessing can you expect on the means for conversion ?

Direction VI. — Presently, if possible, change youf
company, if it hath hitherto been bad ; not by lbr-
saking your necessary relations, but your unneces-
sary sinful companions; and join yourselves with
those that fear the Lord, and inquire of them the
way to heaven. Acts, 9 : 19, 20. Psalm 15 : 4.

Direction VII. — Deliver up yourselves to the Lord
Jesus, as the physician of your souls, that he may
pardon you by Ins blood, and sanctify you by his
Spirit, by his word and ministers, the instruments oi
the Spirit. He is the way, the truth, and the life ,
there is no coming to the Father but by him. John,
14 : 6. Nor is there any other name under heaven
by which you can be saved. Acts, 4 : 12. • Study,
therefore, Ins person and natures, and what he hath
done for you, and what he is to you, and what he
will be, and how he is fitted to the full supply of all
your necessities.

Direction VIII. — If you mean indeed to turn and
live, do it speedily, without delay. If you be not will-
ing to turn to-day, you are not willing to do it at alL
Remember, you are all this while in your blood, un-
der the guilt of many thousand sins, and under God : s
wrath, and you stand at the very brink of hell ; there
is but a step between you and death : and this is not
a case for a man that is well in his wits to be quiet in.
Up therefore presently, and fly as for your lives, as



OocC 7. THE UNCONVERTED. 157

you would be gone out of your house if it were ali on
fire over your head. O, if you did but know in what
continual danger you live, and what daily unspeak-
able loss you sustain, and what a safer and sweeter
life you might live, you would not stand trilling, but
presently turn. Multitudes miscarry that wilfully de-
lay when they are. convinced that it must be done.
Your lives are short and uncertain ; and what a case
are you in if you die before you thoroughly turn ! Ye
have staid too long already, and wronged God too
long. Sin getteth strength while you delay. Your
conversion will grow more hard and doubtful. You
have much to do, and therefore put not all off to the last,
lest God forsake you, and give you up to yourselves,
and then you are undone for ever.

Direction IX. — If you will turn and live, do it un-
leservedly, absolutely, and universally. Think not
to capitulate with Christ, and divide your heart be-
tween him and the world ; and to part with some sins
and keep the rest ; and to let that go which your flesh
can spare. This is but self-deluding; you must in
heart and resolution forsake all that you have, or else
you cannot be his disciples. Luke, 14 : 26, 33. If you
will not take God and heaven for your portion, and
lay all below at the feet of Christ, but you must needs
also have your good things here, and have an earthly
portion, and Gal and glory are not enough for you ;
it is vain to dream of salvation on these terms ; for it
will not be. If you seem never so religious, if yet it
be but a carnal righteousness, and if the flesh's pros-
perity, or pleasure, or safety, be still excepted in your
devotedness to God, this is as certain a way to death
as open profaneness, though it be more plausible.

Rax. Call 14



158 A CALL TO Doct. 1

DiREeriON X. — If you will turn and live, do it re-
solvedly, and stand not still deliberating, as if it were
a doubtful case. Stand not wavering, as if you were
uncertain whether God or the flesh be the better mas-
ter, or whether sin or holiness be the better way, or
whether heaven or hell be the better end. But away
with your former lusts, and presently, habitually,
fixedly resolve. Be not one day of one mind, and the
next day of another ; but be at a point with all the
world, and resolvedly give up yourselves and all you
have to God. Now, while you are reading, or hear-
ing this, resolve ; before you sleep another night, re-
solve ; before you stir from the place, resolve ; before
satan have time to take you off* resolve. You never
turn indeed till you do resolve, and that with a firm
unchangeable resolution.



And now I have done my part in this work, that
you may turn to the call of God, and live. What will
become of it I cannot tell. I have cast the seed at
God's command ; but it is not in my power to give
the increase. I can go no further with my message ;
I cannot bring it to your heart, nor make it work ; I
cannot do your parts for you to entertain it and con-
sider it ; nor can I do God's part, by opening your
heart to entertain it ; nor can I shew heaven or hell
to your sight, nor give you new and tender hearts. If
1 knew what more to do for your conversion, I hope I
should do it.

But O thou that art the gracious Father of spirits,
thou hast sworn thou delightest not in the death of
the wicked, but rather that they turn and live ; deny



Doet 7 THE UNCONVERTED. 15*J

not thy blessing to these persuasions and directions,
and suffer not thine enemies to triumph in thy sight,
and the great deceiver of souls to prevail against thy
Son, thy Spirit, and thy Word ! O pity poor uncon-
verted sinners, that have no hearts to pity or help
themselves I Command the blind to see, and the
deaf to hear, and the dead to live, and let not sin and
death be able to resist thee. Awaken the secure, re-
solve the unresolved, confirm the wavering ; and let
the eyes of sinners, that read these lines, be next em-
ployed in weeping over their sins, and bring them to
themselves, and to thy Son, before their sins have
brought them to perdition. If thou say but the word,
these poor endeavors shall prosper to the winning ol
many a soul to their everlasting joy; and thine ever-
Luting glory. — Aw^n.

PREFACE



COMPILER OF THIS ABRIDGMENT.



In the following pages the reader will find none
of the triumphs peculiar to martyrdom, nor any of
those ecstasies which have distinguished some par-
ticular Christians on their dying beds. Some extra-
ordinary cases rather excite our joyful surprise, than
are patterns for our imitation.

The " Dying Thoughts " of Mr. Baxter chiefly
present to our view what every Christian may attain,
and what it is the highest interest as well as the in-
dispensable duty of every Christian to aspire after.
See here his doubts and fears in the prospect of eter-
nity; though he had spent a long life in exemplary
holiness, and in great nearness to God and heaven.
See his jealousies over his own heart, and anxious
concern to discover his sincerity ; together with his
sober appeals and earnest attention to every dictate
of reason and Scripture, in order to establish his
mind and conscience in a well grounded peace. See,
also, his unwearied striving with God and his own
goul to have his grace in vigorous exercise. All



these are well known ingredients of the Christian
temper ; and therefore tend, not to perplex and dis-
courage, but to counsel, strengthen, and comfort
serious readers, while they discern, in one of Mr.
Baxter's exalted attainments, the same conflicts,
complaints, and desires, which fill their own breasts.

It is observed of Lord William Russell, who
died a martyr fcr the liberty of his country, that a
little before his death, by a trusty messenger, he
sent Mr. Baxter his hearty thanks for his Dying
Thoughts, "which," says he, "have made me better
acquainted with the other world than I was before ;
and have not a little contributed to my support and
relief, and to the fitting me for what I am to go
through."

Though the Dying Thoughts w r ere written about
forty years after the Saints' Rest, yet both are evi-
dently built on the same principles, and are animated
by the same spirit. And let it suffice to add, that
the abridgment of both is conducted in the same
manner.

CONTENTS.



CHAPTER L

WHAT THERE IS DESIRABLE IN THE PRESENT LIFE , . . F. 7

The vanity of raan as mortal. The author's design to speak only to him-
■elf ; with a general plan of tho work. The apostle's happiness whe-
ther in living or dying. The present life is desirable, 1. to please God ;
2. to secure our own salvation ; 3. to do good to others. Minding the
life to come is not the whole of religion The Old Testament saints
duly regarded the present life. The author is thankful for present
mercies to himself, his friends, and country ; especially for his useful-
ness in the church. He desires to improve the remainder of life, and
rejoices in his happy situation.

CHAPTER II.

THE NECESSITY AND REASONABLENESS OF BELIEVING THAT PIOUS
SEPARATE SPIRITS ARE WITH CHRIST 21

I. Such faith is necessary, 1. to ascertain the design of life; 2. to excite
to holiness; 3. to make us know, value, and improve our mercies ; 4.
and to comfort us under sufferings. II. Such faith is reasonable, be-
cause, 1. the soul is immortal; 2. this immortality is the dictate of na-
ture; 3. every man ought to seek happiness; 4. men and brutes differ
in the knowledge of God and futurity; 5- God is a just governor; 6.
and there is a gospel revelation : also because, 7. of God's regard to
prayer; 8. the ministration of angels; 9. Satan's temptations; 10. and
especially the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit. The author
inculcates these considerations upon himself, in order to strengthen his
own faith.

CHAPTER III.

WHAT IT IS TO DEPART AND TO BE WITH CHRIST .... 43
I. To be with Christ includes, !. his presence ; 2. union to him ; 3. com-
munion with him, and with his glorified saints. II. In order to be with
Christ, we must depart, 1. from the body; 2. from former bodily en-
joyments ; and, 3. from the more rational pleasures of learning, friend-
ship, means of grace, and acquaintance with worldly affairs. The
1*



author has no fear that the church will want him. Desires chiefly to
submit to a separation from the body, und laments his soul's attach*
ruent to flesh and sense.

CHAPTER IV.

WHY IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE WITH CHRIST 66

It is far better, considering, 1. our preparation for it, by the Father's
love, the Son's purchase, and the Sjiirit's influences ; by God's word,
ordinances, and providences: and by various other means. 2. It is the
end of all our preparations. 3. It perfects our knowledge of God and
his works; of Christ, and redemption by him ; of heaven and Scripture;
of Providence, of ourselves, of our fellow-creatures, and of our enemies,
sins, and dangers. 4. It perfects our will, conforming it to the will of
God, and fixing it in his love. The author triumphs in the prospect of
such happiness ; traces it. from God's love as the fountain ; through the
love of Christ as the channel ; and through angels and saints as subor-
dinate channels. 5. It perfects also our activity in doing good, particu.
larly in praising God and Christ, and in beneficence to inferior crea-
tures

CHAPTER V.

THE AUTHOR BREATHES AFTER WILLINGNESS TO DEPART, AND TO
BE WITH CHRIST 99

Lamenting the ineffioacy of his convictions, he begs divine teaching ;
argnes against his doubts and fears ; desires a heavenly temper ; then
excites his faith, viewing its support from reason, from experience, and
pleading the promises. 2. He next excites his hope ; views its prepa-
rations, and pleads it in prayer. 3. He also excites his love ; considers
its excellencies ; prays for its increase ; contemplates the perfection of
heavenly love; is jealous of his own love ; enumerates the evidence! oi
God's love, and prays for its full discovery.



DYING THOUGHTS.



PHILIPPIANS, 1 : 23.

For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to cZo
part, and to be with Christ ; which is far better.



CHAPTER I.
What there is desirable in the present life.

"Man that is born of a woman is of few days
and full of trouble : he cometh forth like a flower,
and is cut down : he fleeth also as a shadow, and
continueth not." " And dost thou open thine
eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judg-
ment with thee ?" As a watch when it is wound
up, or as a candle newly lighted ; so man, newly
conceived or born, begins a motion which inces-
santly hastes to its appointed period. And as an
action, or the time of it, is nothing when it is past ;
so vain a thing would man be, and so vain is life,
were it not for the hopes of a more durable life
with which this is connected. But those hopes,
and the means for supporting them, do not only
distinguish a believer from an infidel, but a man
from a beast. When Solomon describes the dif-
ference only in respect to time and the things of
time, he well observes, that one event happening
to both, shows that both are vanity. And Paul
says of Christians, " If in this life only we have



8 WHAT THERE IS DESIRABLE [Chap. i.

hope, we are of all men most miserable." Though
even in this life, as related to a better, and as we
ourselves are exercised about things of a higher
nature than the concerns of a temporal life, we
are far happier than the men of the world.

I am intending to speak to none but myself, and
therefore (supposing the meaning of the text to be
duly ascertained) shall only observe what is use-
ful to my own heart and practice. In this chapter
I will consider — What there is desirable in the pre-
sent life : then show, chapter second — The neces-
sity and reasonableness of believing that pious
separate spirits are with Christ : next explain,
chapter third — What it is to depart, and to be with
Christ: and chapter fourth — Why it is far better
to be with him. I will conclude chapter fifth with
expressing — My concern that I myself may be will-
ing to depart, and to be with Christ.

It was a happy state into which grace had brought
the apostle, who saw so much of what was not only
tolerable, but greatly desirable, both in living and
dying. " For him to live was Christ ;" that is, to
do the work and serve the interest of Christ : for
him " to die was gain ;" that is, would be his own
interest and reward. His strait was not, whether
it would be good to live, or good to depart, be-
cause both were good ; but he doubted which of
the two was more desirable. Nor was it his mean-
ing to bring his own interest and Christ's into com-
petition with each other. By Christ, or the inte-
rest of Christ, he means his serving the churches



Chap. 1.] IN THE PRESENT LIFE. 9

of Christ upon earth. But he knew that Christ
had an interest also in his saints above, and could
raise up more to serve him here. Yet, because he
was to judge by what appeared, and saw that such
were much wanted upon earth, this turned the
scales in his choice ; and therefore, in order to
serve Christ in the edification of his churches, he
was more inclined, by denying himself, to have
his reward delayed ; at this same time well know-
ing that the delay of his reward would tend to its
increase. Here let me observe, " That even in
this world, short of death, there is some good so
much to be regarded, as may justly prevail with
believers to prefer it before the present hasting of
their reward." I rather note this, that no temp-
tation may carry me into the extreme of taking
nothing but heaven to be worth minding; and so
even sinfully cast off the world, on pretence of
mortification and a heavenly life. Not that any
thing on earth is better than heaven, or is in itself
to be preferred before heaven. The end, as such,
is better than the means, and perfection better
than imperfection. But the present use of the
means may be sometimes preferred before the
present possession of the end. And the use of the
means for a higher end, may be preferred before
the present possession of a lower end. Every
thing has its season. Planting, sowing, and build-
ing are not so good as reaping, fruit-gathering,
and dwelling; but in their season they must be
first done.



10 WHAT THERE IS DESIRABLE [Chap. I.

But let me inquire, What there is so desirable
in this present life ? The answer is obvious : for,

1. While this present life continues, the will of
God is fulfilled, who will have us upon earth for
a season ; and that is best which God wills.

2. The life to come depends upon this present
life; as the life of adult age depends upon infan-
cy ; or the reward upon the work ; or the prize
of racers or soldiers upon their running or fight-
ing ; or the merchant's gain upon his voyage.
Heaven is won or lost on earth; the possession
is there, but the preparation is here. Christ will
judge all men in another state, as their works
have been in this. First, " Well done, good and
faithful servant ;" then, " Enter thou into the joy
of thy Lord." " I have fought a good fight, I have
finished my course" must go before the crown
of righteousness " which the Lord the righteous
Judge shall give." All that we ever do for salva-
tion must be done here. It was on earth that Christ
himself wrought the work of our redemption, ful-
filled all righteousness, became our ransom, ant!
paid the price of our salvation ; and here also must
we do our part. The bestowing of the reward is
God's work, who, we are sure, will never fail.
Here is no room for the least suspicion of his fail-
ing in any thing he undertakes ; but the danger
and fear is of our own miscarrying, lest we be not
found capable of receiving what God will certain-
ly give to all that are fit to receive. To distrust
God is heinous sin and folly ; but to distrust our-



Chap. I.] IN THE PRESENT LIFE. 11

selves is highly reasonable. So that if we will
make sure of heaven, it must be by " giving all
diligence to make our calling and election sure"
upon earth. If we fear hell, we must fear our be-
ing prepared for it. And it is great and difficult
work we have to do upon earth ; as, for instance,
to be cured of all damning sin; to be born again;
to be pardoned and justified by faith ; to be united
to Christ, made wise to salvation, renewed by his
Spirit, and conformed to his likeness ; to over-
come all the temptations of the world, the flesh,
and the devil ; to perform all our duties toward
God and man ; " with the heart to believe in Christ
unto righteousness, and with the mouth to make
confession unto salvation ; also to " suffer with
Christ, that we may reign with him ; and be faith-
ful to death, that we may receive the crown of
life." Thus on earth must we " so run that we
may obtain."

3. We must labor to do good to many; and
therefore we have greater work to do on earth
than merely securing our own salvation. We are
intrusted with our Master's talents for his service,
to do our best in our places, to propagate his
truth and grace, to edify his church, honor his
cause, and promote the salvation of as many souls
eis we can. All this is to be done on earth, if we
would secure the end of all in heaven.

It is then an error, though but few are guilty
of it, to think that all religion lies in minding only
the life to come, and in disregarding all things in



12 WHAT THERE IS DESIRABLE [Chap. L

this present life. All true Christians must sen-
ously mind both the end and the means of attain-
ing it. If they believingly mind not the end, they
will never be faithful in the use of the means ; it
they be not diligent in using the means, they will
never obtain the end. Heaven must have our.
highest esteem, and our habitual love, desire, and
joy ; but earth must have more of our daily thoughts
for present practice. A man that travels to the
most desirable home, has an habitual desire to it
all the way; but his present business is his jour-
ney, and therefore his horse, inns and company,
his roads and his fatigues, may employ more of
his thoughts, and talk, and action, than his home.
I have often wondered to find David, in the
Psalms, and other saints before the coming of
Christ, express so great a sense of the things of
this present life, and say so little of another; ma-
king so much account of prosperity, dominion,
and victories on the one hand, and of persecution
and the success of enemies on the other hand.
But I consider that it was not for mere personal
and carnal interest, but for the church of God,
and for his honor, word, and worship ; for they
knew, if things go well with us on earth, they will
be sure to go well in heaven ; if the militant church
prosper in holiness, there is no doubt but it will
triumph in glory. Satan does much of his damn-
ing work by men, as his instruments ; so that if we
escape their temptations, we escape much of our
danger. When idolaters prospered, Israel was



Chap. I.J tN THE PRESENT LIFE* 13

tempted to idolatry. Most follow the powerful
nnd prosperous side. And therefore, for the glory
uf God, and for our own everlasting salvation, we
must, while upon earth, greatly regard our own,
and much more the church's welfare. Indeed, if
earth be desired only for earth, and prosperity be
loved only to gratify the flesh, it is the certain
mark of damning carnality and an earthly mind.
But to desire peace and prosperity for the sake
of souls, the increase of the church, and the honor
of God, that " his name may be hallowed, his king-
dom come, and his will be done on earth as it is
in heaven," accords with the highest and most sa-
cred discharge of duty.

" And now, O my soul ! be not unthankful for
the mercies of this present life. This body is so
nearly united to thee, that it must needs be a great
help or hinderance. Had it been more afflicted,
it might have been a discouraging clog; like a
tired horse in a journey, or an ill tool to a work-
man, or an untuned instrument in music. A sick
or a bad servant in a house is a great trouble, and
much more a bad wife : but thy body is nearer to
thee than either of these could be, and will be
more of thy concern. Yet if it had been more
strong and healthful, sense and appetite would
have been strong ; and the stronger thy lusts the
greater would have been thy danger, and much
more difficult thy victory and salvation. Even
weak senses and temptations have too often pre-
vailed How knowest thou then what stronger

2 Dying Thoughts.



14 WHAT THERE IS DESIRABLE [Chap. 1,

might have done ? When I see a thirsty man in a
fever, or dropsy ; and especially when I see strong
and healthful youth bred up in fullness and among
temptations, how they are mad in sin_, violently
carried to it, bearing down the rebukes of God
and conscience, parents and friends, and all re-
gard to their own salvation ; tins tells me how
great a mercy I had, even in a body not liable to
their case. Also, many a bodily deliverance has
been of great use to my soul, renewing my time,
and opportunity, and strength for service, and
bringing frequent and fresh reports of the love of
God. If bodily mercies were not of great use to
the soul, Christ would not so much have showed
his saving love as he did, by healing all manner
of diseases. Nor would God promise us a resur-
rection of the body, if a suitable body did not pro-
mote the welfare of the soul.

" I am obliged to great thankfulness to God for
the mercies of this life which he hath showed to
my friends. That which promotes their joy should
increase mine. 1 ought to ' rejoice with them that
rejoice.' Nature and grace teach us to be glad
when our friends are well and prosper ; though all
this must be in order to better things than bodily
welfare.

" Nor must I undervalue such mercies of this
life as belong to the land of my nativity. The
want of them is part of God's threatened curse ;
and * godliness has a promise of the life that now
is, and of that which is to come, and so is profita-



Chap. I.J m THE PRESENT LIFE. 15

ble unto all things.' When God sends on a land
the plagues of pestilence, war, persecution, and
famine, especially a famine of the word of God, it
is a great sin to be insensible of them. If any shall
say, ' While heaven is sure, we have no cause to
accuse God, or to cast away comfort, hope, or
duty,' they say well. But if they say, ' Because
heaven is all, we must make light of all that be-
falls us on earth,' they say amiss. Pious and pub-
lic-spirited men, who promote the safety, peace,
and true prosperity of the commonwealth, do
thereby very much befriend religion and men's
salvation, and are greatly to be loved and honored
by all. Let me therefore be thankful for the pre-
servation from enemies, the restraint of persecu-
tion, the concord of Christians, and increase of
godliness, in this land, and especially that the
Gospel is continued in it.

" Be particularly thankful, O my soul ! that God
hath made any use of thee for the service of his
church on earth. My God, my soul for this doth
magnify thee, and my spirit rejoiceth in the re-
view of thy great undeserved mercy. O what am
I, whom thou tookest up from the dunghill, or
low obscurity, that I should live myself in the
constant relish of thy sweet and sacred truth, and
with such encouraging success communicate it to
others ! that I may say, now my public work
seems ended, that these forty-three or forty-four
years I have no reason to think that ever I la-
bored in vain ! O wit!* what gratitude must I look

upon all places where I lived and labored ; but,
above all, that place which had my strength !* I
bless thee for the great numbers of them gone to
heaven, and for the continuance of piety, humility,
concord, and peace among them. Also for all
that by my writings have received any saving
light and grace. O my God, let not my own heart
be barren while I labor in thy husbandry to bring
others unto holy fruit ! Let me not be a stranger
to the life and power of that saving truth which
I have done so much to communicate to others !
O let not my own words and writings condemn
me as void of that divine and heavenly nature and
life which I have said so much of to the world !

" Stir up then, O my soul, thy sincere desires,
and all thy faculties, to do the remnant of the work
of Christ appointed thee on earth, and then joy-
fully wait for the heavenly perfection in God's
own time. Thou canst truly say, * To me to live
is Christ.' It is his work for which thou livest.
Thou hast no other business in the world. But
thou doest this work with a mixture of many over-
sights and imperfections, and too much troubles!
thy thoughts with distrust about God's part, who
never fails. If thy work be done, be thankful for
what is past, and that thou art come so near the
port of rest. If God will add any more to thy days,
serve him with double alacrity. The prize is al-
most within sight. Time is swift and short. Thou
hast told others that ' there is no working in the

grave,' and that it must be ' now or never.' Dream
not, because Christ's righteousness was perfect,
that God will save the wicked, or equally reward
the slothful and the diligent. As sin is its own
punishment, holiness is much of its own reward.
Whatever God appointed thee to do, see that thou
do it sincerely, and with all thy might. If sin dis-
pose men to be angry because it is detected, dis-
graced, and resisted ; so that God be pleased, their
wrath should be patiently borne, who will shortly
be far more angry with themselves. I shall not be
hurt when I am with Christ, by the calumnies ot
men on earth ; but the saving benefit will, by con-
verted sinners, be enjoyed everlastingly. Words
and actions are transient things, and being once
past, are nothing ; but the effect of them on an im-
mortal soul may be endless. All the sermons that
I have preached are nothing now; but the grace
of God on sanctified souls is the beginning of eter-
nal life. It is an unspeakable mercy to be thus
employed sincerely and with success ; and there-
fore I had reason all this while to be in Paul's
strait, and make no haste in my • desires to de-
part.' The crown will come in its due time; and
eternity is long enough to enjoy it, how long so-
ever it be delayed. But if I will do that which
must obtain it for myself and others, it must be
quickly done, before my declining sun be set. O
that I had no worse causes of my unwillingness
yet to die, than my desire to do the work of life
for my own and other men's salvation, and to

* finish my course with joy, and the ministry ]
have received of the Lord!'

" As it is on earth I must do good to others, so
it must be in a manner suited to their earthly state.
Souls are here closely united to bodies, by which
they must receive much good or hurt. Do good
to men's bodies, if thou wouldest do good to their
souls. Say not, Things corporeal are worthless
trifles, for which the receivers will be never the
better. They are things that nature is easily sen-
sible of, and sense is the passage to the mind and
will. Dost thou not find what a help it is to thyself,
to have at any time any ease and alacrity of body ;
and what a burden and hinderance pains and cares
are ? Labor then to free others from such burdens
and temptations, and be not regardless of them.
If thou must ' rejoice with them that rejoice, and
weep with them that weep/ promote then thy
own joy by helping theirs, and avoid thy own sor-
rows in preventing or curing theirs. But, alas !
what power has selfishness in most ! How easily
do we bear our brethren's pains and reproaches,
wants and afflictions, in comparison of our own !
How few thoughts and how little cost and labor
do we use for their supply, in comparison of what
we do for ourselves ! Nature indeed teaches us to
be sensible of our own case ; but grace tells us
that we should not make so great a difference as
we do, but should love our neighbor as ourselves.

" And now, O my soul, consider how merciful-
ly God has dealt with thee, that thy strait should



Chap. 1.] IN THE PRESENT LIFE. 19

be between two conditions so desirable. I shall
either die speedily, or stay yet longer upon earth ;
whichever it be, it will be a merciful and com-
fortable state. That it is ' desirable to depart, and
be with Christ,' I must not doubt, and shall here-
after more copiously consider. And if my abode
on earth yet longer be so great a mercy as to be
put into the balance against my present posses-
sion of heaven, surely it must be a state which
obliges me to great thankfulness to God and com-
fortable acknowledgment : nor should my pain, or
sickness, or sufferings from men, make this life on
earth unacceptable while God will continue me in
it. Paul had his thorn in the flesh, the messenger
of Satan to buffet him, and suffered more from
men than I have done ; and yet he * gloried in his
infirmities, and rejoiced in his tribulations,' and
was ' in a strait betwixt' living and dying; yea,
rather chose to live yet longer. Alas ! the strait
of most men is between the desire of life for flesh-
ly interest, and the fear of death as ending their
felicity; between a tiring world and body, which
make them weary of living, and the dreadful pros-
pect of future danger, which makes them afraid of
dying. If they live, it is in misery; if they must
die, they fear greater misery : whether they look
behind or before them, to this world or the next,
fear and trouble is their lot. Yea, many serious
Christians, through the weakness of their trust in
God, live in this perplexed strait, weary of living
and afraid of dying, continually pressed between



20 WHAT THERE IS DESIRABLE, &c. [Chap. I

grief and fear. But Paul's strait was between two
joys, which oi' them he should desire most. And
if that be my case, what should much interrupt
my peace or pleasure? If I live, it is for Christ,
for his service, and to prepare for my own and his
everlasting felicity ; and should any suffering make
me impatient with such a work, and such a life ?
If I die presently, it is my gain ; God, who ap-
points me my work, limits my time ; and surely
his glorious reward can never be unseasonable, or
come too soon, if it be the time that he appoints.
When I first engaged myself to preach the Gospel,
I reckoned, as probable, but upon one or two
years, and God has made it above forty-four. And
what reason have I to be unwilling now, either to
live or die? God's service has been so sweet to
me that it has overcome the trouble of constant
pains or weakness of the flesh, and all that men
have said and done against me. How much the
following exceeds this pleasure, I am not now able
to conceive. There is some trouble in all this plea-
sant work, from which the soul and flesh would
rest. And * blessed are the dead which die in the
Lord ; yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest
from their labors, and their works do follow them.'
O my soul, what need has this kind of strait to
trouble thee ? Leave God to his own work, and
mind that which is thine. So live that thou may-
est say, ' Christ liveth in me ; and the life which I
now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the
Son of God, who loved me, ar.«l gave himself for



Chap. II.] PIOUS SEPARATE SPIRITS. 2 J

me.' Ther, as thou hast lived in the comfort of
hope, thou shalt die in the comfort of vision and
enjoyment. And when thou canst say of God,
* Whose I am, and whom I serve ;' that thou may-
est boldly add, ' I know whom I have believed,
and into his hands I commit my departing spirit, "



CHAPTES II.



The necessity and reasonableness of believing that pi-
ous separate spirits are with Christ.

The subject suggests to my thoughts — the ne-
cessity of believing that the souls of the godly,
when departed hence, shall be with Christ — and
the reasonableness of such a faith. We are else-
where assured, that " we shall be with him, where
he is;" and to be with him can mean no less than
a state of communion, and a participation of hap-
piness. To believe such a state of happiness for
departed pious souls, must appear, upon conside-
ration, to be both necessary and reasonable.

I. The necessity of believing that pious sepa-
rate spirits are with Christ, appears by consider-
ing, that, without this belief— we shall be uncer-
tain concerning the design of life — we shall lose
the most powerful motives to a holy life — we can
neither know, estimate, nor improve our mercies—
nor can we bear our sufferings with comfort.



22 PIOUS SEPARATE SPIRITS [ C haP- H

1. We shall be uncertain concerning the design
of life. It is allowed, that the right end of life is
to please God. But I must desire to please God
better than I do in this imperfect state>, I must de-
sire to please him perfectly. And our desires of
our ultimate end must have no bounds. God has
made the desire of our own happiness so necessa-
ry to the soul of man, that it cannot be separated
from our desire to please him. Therefore, both
in respect to God and to our own happiness, we
must believe that he is the everlasting " rewarder
of them that diligently seek him." If we knew
not whether God will turn our pleasing him to our
loss, or to our having no gain by pleasing him,
this would hinder our love to him, and our trust
and joy in him ; and consequently hinder the cheer-
fulness, sincerity, and constancy of our obedience
Had we no certainty what God will do with us
we must have some probability and hope before
we can be entirely devoted to his service. How
can a man pitch upon an uncertain end? If he
waver so as to have no end, he can use no weans ;
he lives not as a man, but as a brute. Or if he
pitch upon a wrong end, he will but make work
for repentance.

2. We shall lose the most powerful motives to
a holy life. Indeed, goodness is desirable for itself;
but the goodness of means is their iitness for the
end. We have here abundance of hinderances,
temptations, and difficulties, which must be over-
come. Our natures are diseased, and greatly in-



Chap. U.J ARE WITH CHRIST. 23

disposed to the most necessary duties ; and will
they ever be discharged, if the necessary motives
be not believed ? Our duties to God and man may
cost us our estates, liberties, and lives. The world
is not so happy as commonly to know good men
from bad, or to encourage piety and virtue, or to
forbear opposing them. And who will let go his
present welfare without some hope of better as a
reward ? Men do not use to " serve God for
naught," or while they think it will be their loss
to serve him. A life of sin will not be avoided
for inferior motives. When lust and appetite in-
cline men strongly and constantly to their respec-
tive objects, what shall sufficiently restrain them,
except the motives from things external ? If sin
so overspread the earth, notwithstanding all the
hopes and fears of a life to come, what would it
do if there were no such hopes and fears ?

3. We can neither know, estimate, nor improve
our mercies. — God gives us all the mercies of this
life as helps to an immortal state of glory, and as
earnests of it. Sensualists know not what a soul
is, nor what soul-mercies are, and therefore know
not the just value of all bodily mercies ; but take
up only with the carcass, shell, or shadow, instead
of the life of their mercies. No wonder they are
so unthankful for God's mercies, when they know
not the real excellency of them.

4. Nor can we bear our present sufferings with
comfort, without the hope of living with Christ. —
What should support and comfort me under my



24 PIOUS SEPARATE SPIRITS [Chap. It

bodily languishings and pains, my weary hours,
and daily experience of the vanity and vexation
of all things under the sun, had I not a prospect
of the comfortable end of all? I, that have lived
in the midst of great and precious mercies, have
all my life had something to do to overcome the
temptation of wishing that I had never been born ;
and had never overcome it, but by the belief of a
blessed life hereafter. We should be strongly
tempted, in our considerate moments, to murmur
at our Creator, as dealing worse by us than by
the brutes ; if we must have had all those cares,
and griefs, and fears, by the knowledge of what
we want, and the prospect of death and future
evils, which they are exempted from, and had not
withal the hope of future felicity to support us.
Seneca had no better argument to silence such
murmurers, than to tell them, " If this life have
more evil than good, and you think God does you
wrong, you may remedy yourselves by ending it
when you will." But that could not cure the re-
pinings of nature, when weary of the miseries of
life, and yet afraid of dying. No wonder that so
many fancied that souls were punished in these
bodies for something done in a pre-existent state.
" O how contemptible a thing is man," says Sen-
eca, " unless he lifts up himself above human
things." Therefore, says Solomon, when he had
tried all sensual enjoyments, •• I hated life, be-
cause the work that is wrought under the sun is
grievous unto me ; for all is vanity and vexation
of spirit."



Chap. Il.J ARE WITH CHRIST. 35

II. As for the reasonableness of believing
that pious separate spirits are with Christ — I have
often thought, whether an implicit belief of it may
not be better than searching into its nature, and
trying what can be said against it. I have known
many godly women who never disputed the mat-
ter, but served God comfortably to a very old age,
and who lived many years in such a cheerful rea-
diness and desire for death as few studious men
ever attain to. This no doubt was the divine re-
ward of their unwavering confidence and trust in
the promises through Christ. On the contrary,
as doubts and difficulties are apt to present them-
selves to an inquisitive mind, they must be an-
swered ; for if we reject them unanswered, we
give them half the victory over us ; and a faith
that is not upheld by such evidence of truth as
reason can discern and justify, is often joined with
much doubting, which men dare not confess, but
do not therefore overcome ; and the weakness of
such a faith may tend to enfeeble all the graces
and duties which should be strengthened by it.
Who knows how soon a temptation from Satan,
or infidels, or from our own dark hearts, may as-
sault us, which will not be overcome without clear
evidence? Yet many that try, and reason, and
dispute most, have not the stronger faith. Indeed,
there is a wide difference between that light which
discovers the thing itself, and a mere artificial
kind of knowledge, to form arguments and answer
objections. Unlearned persons, who have little

26 PIOUS SEPARATE SPIRITS [Chap. IL

of the latter may have more of the former, even
that teaching from God which reaches the heart
as well as the understanding. And who does not
rind it necessary to pray hard for this divine
teaching? When I can prove the truth of the
word of God, and of the life to come, with the
most convincing evidence of reason, I feel my
need to cry daily to God to " increase my faith,"
and to give me that light which may sanctify the
soul and reach the end. Nevertheless, this effec-
tual teaching ordinarily supposes that which is ar-
tificial. Unlearned Christians are convinced, by
good evidence, that God's word is true, and his
rewards sure : though they cannot state that evi-
dence, or conceive of it without some confusion.
With respect to curious and needless inquiries
beyond what is levealed, it is a believer's wisdom
implicitly to trust his soul to Christ, and to fear
that vain, vexatious knowledge, which is selfish,
and savors of a distrust of God, and is that sin,
and fruit of sin, which the learned world too lit-
tle fears. That " God is the rewarder of them
that diligently seek him," and that holy souls
shall be in blessedness with Christ, I am con-
vinced by the following concurrent evidences, en
which my soul raises its hopes: — The immortal-
ity of the soul — the belief of it naturally implant-
ed in all men — the duty of all men to seek after
future happiness — the difference between men and
brutes, concerning the knowledge of God and fu-
turity — the justice of God, as the governor of the



Chap. II. J ARE WITH CHRIST 27

world — divine revelation — God's hearing and an
swering prayer — the ministration of angels — the
temptations of Satan, and especially the sancti-
fying operations of the Spirit of God.

1. The soul of man is immortal — and there-
fore, if good, cannot be for ever in a bad condi-
tion. An immortal spirit is " a distinct, self-
conscieus, invisible being, endowed with natural
powers of never-ceasing action, understanding
and will, and which is neither annihilated nor de-
stroyed by separation of parts." Such is the soul
of man. If in this flesh our spirits were not in-
active and useless, we have no reason to think
that they will be so hereafter, and that for ever.
Though by the light of nature we may know the
immortality of souls, yet without supernatural
light we know not what manner of action they
will have in their separate state. It satisfies me,
that God will not continue their noblest powers
in vain ; and how those powers shall be exercised
is known to him; and this his word tells us more
than nature. All things considered, there is no
reason to fear that souls shall lose their activity,
though they change their manner of action : and
so it is naturally certain that they are immortal
And if holy souls are so far immortal, their holi-
ness must prove their happy immortality. This
the most just and holy God will certainly secure
to those whom he makes holy.

2. The belief of the soul's immortality is na-
turally implanted in all men. — Almost all pagan



28 PIOUS SEPARATE SPIRITS [Chap. 11.

nations at this day, as well as the Mahommedans,
believe it. As for the cannibals and savages,
whose understandings are least improved, they are
rather ignorant of it than disbelieve it. Though
some philosophers denied it, they were every way
inconsiderable : though many others were doubt-
ful, it was only a certainty which they professed
to want, and not a probability. Most of the apos-
tates from Christianity, beside those philoso-
phers who have been its violent opposers, fully
acknowledged it. Julian was so persuaded of it,
that with a view to it he exhorted his priests and
the rest of his subjects to great strictness of life,
and to see that the Christians did not exceed them.
Indeed, few of those that affect, like the Sad-
ducees, to disbelieve it, are able to free them-
selves from the fears of future misery ; but, with
all their efforts, conscience still troubles them.
And whence should all this be in man, and not in
beasts, if man had no more cause for hopes and
fears than they?

3. God has made it every man's duty to seek
after future happiness as the one thing needful,
and therefore there must certainly be such a
happiness for them that truly seek it. Some be
lieve a state of future retribution, as Christians
Mahommedans, and most heathens. Others think
it is uncertain, yet very probable. And to others
it is also uncertain, though they rather think it
untrue. Now all these ought to seek after it, and
make it their chief care and labor; for natural rea-



Chap. II. J ARE WITH CHRIST. 29

son requires every man to seek that which is best
with the greatest diligence, and assures us that a
probability or possibility of future everlasting
happiness is better, and more worthy to be sought,
than any thing attainable in this present life. As
the will of man necessarily desires happiness, it
must'desire that most which is best, and which is
known to be so. In this life there is nothing cer-
tain for an hour. It is certain that the longest
life is short. It is certain that time and sensual
pleasure, when past, are nothing, and no better
than if they had never been. It \s also certain
that they are dissatisfying while we possess them ;
for carnal pleasure is no sweeter to a man than
to a beast, and to a beast is unattended with fear
of death, or any misery after death; nor has the
beast any labors, sufferings, or trials, in order to
obtain a future happiness, or avoid a future mis-
ery. Beside, it is self-evident, from the perfec-
tions of God, and from the nature of his works
that he does not make it man's natural duty 10
care and labor most for that which is not, or to
seek what is not to be attained, If so, the duty
of man would result from deceit and falsehood;
and God would govern the world by a lie, and
not by power, wisdom, and love ; and the better
any man was, and the more he did his duty, he
would be only the more deluded and miserable ;
and the more wicked and unbelieving any man
was, the wiser and happier would he be. But all
this is contrary to the perfections and works of
d 3*



30 PIODS SEPARATE SPIRITS [Chap. 11

God ; for he makes nothing in vain, nor can lie
lie : much less will he make holiness itself, and
all that duty and work of life which reason obli-
ges all men to perform, to be not only vain, but
pernicious.

4. The difference between men and brutes with
respect to the knowledge of God and futurity,
shows that they differ as much in their hopes.
Man knows that there is a God by his works ; and
that this God is our Lord, our ruler, and end ;
and that we naturally owe him all our love and
obedience ; and that it is not the manner, even of
good men, ever to suffer their most faithful ser-
vants to be losers by their fidelity, or to set them
upon laboring in vain. Man also knows that his
own soul is immortal, and therefore must be well
or ill for ever, and that this ou?ht to be cared for.
And why should God give man all this knowledge
more than the brutes, if man is designed for no
more happiness than brutes? Every wise man
makes his work fit for its design ; and will not
God do so? If God was not perfectly wise, he
would not be God. Therefore to deny man's fu
ture hopes, is to deny God himself.

5. The justice of God as the governor of the
world, infers a slate of future retribution. If
God did not govern man by laws, judgment, and
executions, there would be no proper law of na-
ture, and man would have no proper duty, nor
be in sin or fault. But experience tells us that
God morally governs the world ; and his right to



Chap. II.J ARE WITH CHRIST 31

do so is unquestionable. If God was not the ru-
ler of the world, the world would have no univer-
sal laws; for no man is the universal ruler; nor
are kings, and other supreme powers, utterly law-
less and ungoverned. And if God be a ruler, he
is just ; else he is not so good as he requires earth-
ly princes to be. But how is God a righteous ru-
ler, if he draws all men to him by deceit? if he
obliges them to seek and expect a reward which
he will never give? if he makes man's duty his
misery 1 if he requires man to labor in vain ? if he
suffer the wicked to persecute and kill his ser-
vants,, without punishing the one and gloriously
recompensing the other, in a future state?

6. The gospel revelation is the clear founda-
tion of our faith and hope. God has not left us
to the mere light of nature. " Christ has brought
life and immortality to light." One greater
than an angel was sent from heaven to tell us what
is there, and which is the way, and to secure our
hopes. He has conquered death, and entered be-
fore us, as our captain and forerunner, into the
everlasting habitations. He has " all power in
heaven and earth, and all judgment is commit-
ted to him." All his word is full of promises of
our future glory at the resurrection. Nor are we
without assurance that the departing soul at death
enters upon a state of joy and blessedness, as ap-
pears by the promise to the penitent thief on the
cross ; — the parable of the rich man and Lazarus ;
— Christ's telling the sadducees that God ; " is not



32 PIOUS SEPARATE SPIRITS [Chap. II

the God of the dead, but of the living;" — the
translation of Enoch and Elijah, and the appear-
ance of Moses with Elijah on the mount of trans-
figuration; our Lord's arguing, that "they who
Kill the body are not able to kill the soul:" —
his "commending his spirit into his Father's
hands," and its being in paradise, while his body
was in the grave ; — his promising, " Where I am,
there shall also my servant be," &c. — Stephen's
seeing heaven opened, and his praying, "Lord
Jesus receive my spirit;" — our being "come to
the spirits of just men made perfect;" — Paul's de-
siring to depart, and to be with Christ, which is
far better, and to be absent from the body, and
present with the Lord; — the blessedness of the
dead who die in the Lord; — the disobedient spi-
rits being in prison, and the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah suffering the vengeance of eternal fire ;
— also Christ's saying, "When ye fail, (that is,
leave this world,) ye shall be received into e'er
lasting habitations."

7. God's hearing and answering prayer in this
life, assures his servants that he is their true ;md
faithful Savior. How often have I cried to him
when there appeared to be no help in second
causes; and how frequently, suddenly, and mer-
cifully, has he delivered me ! Such extraordinary
changes, beyond my own and others' expectations,
while many plain-hearted, upright Christians, by
fasting and prayer, sought God on my behalf,
have abundantly convinced me of a special provi-



Chap. II.] ARE WITH CHRIST. 33

dence, and that God is indeed a hearer of prayer.
I have also seen wonders done for others by prayer
more than for myself: though I and others are too
much like those who " cried unto the Lord in
their trouble, and he saved them out of their dis-
tresses ; but they forgot his works, and his won-
ders that he showed them." And what were all
those merciful answers, but the fruits of Christ's
power, faithfulness, and love, the fulfilling of his
promises, and the earnest of the greater blessing
of immortality, which the same promises entitle
me to ?

8. The ministration of angels is also a help to
my belief of immortality with Christ. — " They
have charge over us, — encamp round about us, —
bear us up in their hands, — joy in the presence of
God over our repentance, — and are all ministering
spirits, sent forth to minister to the heirs of sal-
vation. — As our angels, they always behold the
face of our Father which is in heaven. — When
the Son of man shall come in his glory, all the
holy angels shall come with him, and he shall
send them forth, and they shall sever the wicked
from among the just." Not only of old did they
appear to the faithful as messengers from God, but
many mercies does God give to us by their min-
istry. And that they are now so friendly and
helpful to us, and make up one society with us,
greatly encourages us to hope that we are made
for the same region, employment, and converse.
They were once in a life of trial, though not on

earth; and having overcome, they rejoice in our
victory. The world above us is not uninhabited,
nor beyond our capacity and hope ; but we are
come to the city of the Jiving God, and to an in
numerable company of angels.

9. Even Satan himself by his temptations has
many ways cherished my hopes of immortality
There are {e\v men, I think, that observe what
masses within them, but have had some experience
of such inward temptations, as show that the au-
thor of them is an invisible enemy, and assure us
that there are diabolical spirits, which seek man's
misery by tempting him to sin, and consequently
that future happiness or misery must be expected
by us all.

10. More especially the sanctifying operations
of the Spirit of God, are the earnest of heaven,
and the sure prognostic of our immortal happi-
ness. It is a change of grand importance to man,
to be renewed in his mind, his will, and life. It
repairs his depraved faculties. It causes man to
live as man, who was degenerated to a life too much
like the brutes. Men are slaves to sin till Christ
makes them free. " Where the Spirit of the Lord is
there is liberty." If" the love of God shed abroad
in our hearts," be not our excellence, health, and
beauty, what is ? " That which is born of the flesh
is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is
spirit. " Without Christ" and his Spirit, " we can
do nothing." Our dead notions and reason, though
we see the truth, have not power to overcome



Chap. II.] ARE WITH CHRIST. 3j>

temptations, nor raise up man's soul to its origi-
nal end, nor possess us with the love and joy-
ful hope of future blessedness. It were better for
us to have no souls, than have our souls void of
the Spirit of God. — Heaven is the design and end
of this important change. What is our knowledge
and faith, but to know and believe that heaven
consists in the glory and love of God there ma-
nifested, and that it was purchased by Christ, and
given by his covenant? What is our hope, but
" the hope of glory," which we through the Spirit
wait for? What is our love, but a desire of com-
munion with the blessed God, begun here, and
perfected hereafter? What Christ teaches and
commands, he works in us by his Spirit. He
sends not his Spirit to make men craftier than
others for this world, but " wiser to salvation,"
and more holy and heavenly. " The children of
this world are in their generation wiser than the
children of light." Heavenly mindedness is the
special work of the Spirit. In producing this
change, the Spirit overcomes all opposition from
the world, the flesh, and the devil. Christ first
overcame the world, and teaches and causes us
to overcome it, even in its flatteries and its frowns,
" Our faith is our victory." Whether this victory
be easy and honorable to the Spirit of Christ, let
us appeal to our experience of the wickedness of
the world, and of our own weakness and falls.

greatest princes. Evil angels neither can, nor v
do it. Good angels do nothing toward it, but
obedient ministers of God. We cannot quicki
illuminate, or sanctify ourselves ; and though
have some power, both conscience and experien
testify, that we have nothing but " what we ha
received," — Christ promised his Sp'rit to all tr
believers, to be in them as his advocate, agei

That this Spirit is given to all true believers,
evident by the effects of it. They have enr

kind : they live upon the hope of a better life, a
their heavenly interest overrules all the opposi
interests of this world ; in order to which th
live under the conduct of divine authority, and
obey and please God is the great business of t*
lives. The men of the world discern this diflt
ence, and therefore hate and oppose them becau
they find themselves condemned by their heaven

of this difference ; for they desire to be better, a:

'eakest condition they would fain be perfect,
ndeed, whatever real goodness is found among
nen, it is given by the same Spirit of Christ : but
t is notorious, that, in heavenly mindedness and
irtue, no part of the world is comparable to seri-
es Christians. This Spirit, Christ also expressly
•romised, as the means and pledges, the first-fruits

t is a certain proof that we shall have such a glo*
y. He that gives us such a spiritual change,

thy choice to sit at the feet of Jesus, and hear his
word, as the better part, and count the honors
and preferments of the vvorid but dung and dross ?
Who breathed in all those rea x uests thou hast sent
up to God? Overvalue not corrupt nature, it
brings forth no such fruits as these. Remember
what thou wast in the hour of temptation, how
small a matter has drawn thee to sin. Forget not
the days of thy youthful vanity. Overlook not
the case of thy sinful neighbors, who, in the
midst of light, still live in darkness, and hear not
th»e loudest calls of God. Is it no work of Christ's
Spirit that has made thee to differ? Thou hast
nothing to boast of, and much to be humbled and
also to be thankful for. Thy holy desires are,
alas ! too weak ; but they are holy. Thy love
has been too cold ; but it is the most holy God
whom thou hast loved. Thy hopes have been too
low ; but thou hast hoped in God, and for his hea-
venly glory. Thy prayers have been too dull and
interrupted ; but thou hast prayed for holiness and
heaven. Thy labors have been too slothful ; but
thou hast labored for God and Christ, and the
good of mankind. Though thy motion was too
weak and slow, it has been God-ward, and there-
tore it is from God. O bless the Lord, not only
lor giving thee his word, and sealing it with un-
controled miracles, but also for frequently and
remarkably fulfilling his promises, in the answer
of thy prayers, and in great deliverance of thyself
upd of many others; and that he has by regenera-

tion been preparing thee for the light of glory!
And wilt thou yet doubt and fear, against all this
evidence, experience, and foretaste?

I think it no needless labor to confirm my soul
in the full persuasion of the truth of its immortal
nature, and of a future life of joy or misery, and
of the certain truth of the Christian faith. I can
no more doubt the being and perfections of God,
than whether there be an earth or a sun. Chris-
tianity is only known by revelation, which is so
attested externally to the w r orld, internally to holy
souls, as makes faith a ruling, victorious, and com-
fortable principle. But the soul's immortality and
future reward is known in some measure by the
light of nature, and more perfectly by revelation.
When I consider the great unlikeness of men's
hearts and lives to such a belief as we all profess,
I cannot but fear, that not only the ungodly, but
most that truly hope for glory, have a far weaker
belief of the soul's immortality, and the truth of
the gospel, than they are apt to imagine. Can I
be fully persuaded of the future rewards and pun-
ishments of souls, and that we shall be judged
hereafter as we have lived here, without despising
all the vanities of the world, and setting my heart
with resolution and diligence to a holy, heavenly
fruitful life? Who could stand trifling, as most
men do, at the door of eternity, that verily believed
his immortal soul must be shortly there ? Though
such a one had no certainty of his own salvation,
he would nevertheless search and try, watch and



40 PI0U3 SEPARATE SPIRITS [Chap. II.

pray, and spare no care, cost, or labor, to make
all sure. If a man once saw heaven and hell,
would he not afterward exceed the most resolute
believer ? I confess there is much weakness of
faith in things unseen, even where there is since-
rity. But where there is little diligence for the
world to come, I must think there is but little be-
lief of it, and that such persons are not aware how
much they secretly doubt the truth of it. Most
complain of the uncertainty of their title to salva-
tion, and very little of their uncertainty whether
there be a heaven and a hell. Whereas a hearty
persuasion of the latter, would do more to con-
vince them of the former than long examinations,
and many marks of trial. It would, indeed, con-
found faith and reason, if in the body we had as
clear and lively apprehensions of heaven and hell
as sight would occasion ; nor is the soul fit, while
in the body, to bear such a sight. But yet there
is an overruling seriousness, to which the soul
must be brought by a firm persuasion of future
things. And he that is careful and serious for
this world, and looks after a better only as a se-
condary object, must give me leave to think that
he believes but as he lives, and that his doubting
of a heaven and hell is greater than his belief.

O then, for what should my soul more pray,
than for a clearer and stronger faith? " I believe;
Lord help my unbelief!" I have many thousand
times groaned to thee under litis burden of remain-
ing darkness and unbelief: 1 have many thousand



Chap. II. J ARE WITH CHRIST. 41

times thought of the evidences of Christianity;
and of the necessity of a lively, powerful, active
faith. I have cried to thee night and day, ' Lord,
increase my faith !' I have written and spoken
that to others, which might be most useful to my-
self, and render my faith more like sense. Yet,
Lord, how dark is this world ! What a dungeon
is flesh ! How little clearer are my perceptions of
things unseen, than they were long ago ! Is no
more growth of them to be expected? Does the
soul no more increase in vigorous perception,
when the body no mors increases in the vigor
of sensation ?• Must I sit down with so slow a
measure, when I am almost there, where faith is
changed for sight? O let not a soul, that is driv-
en from this world, and weary of vanity, and can
think of little else but immortality, that seeks and
cries both night and day for the heavenly light,
and fain would have some foretaste of glory, and
some more of the first-fruits of the promised joys,
— let not such a soul either long, or cry, or strive
in vain ! Punish not my former grieving of thy
Spirit, by deserting a soul that cries for thy grace*
so near its great and inconceivable change ! Let
me not languish in vain desires, at the door of
hope ; nor pass with doubts and fears from this
vale of misery ! Which should be the season of
triumphant faith, and hope, and joy, if not when
I am entering on the world of joy? O thou, that
hast left us so many words of promise, * that our
joy may be full : send, O send the Comforter* for

without his heavenly beams, after a thousand
thoughts and cares, it will still be night and win-
ter with my soul !"

But I fear a distrust of God and my Redeemer
has had too great a hand in my desires after a
more distinct knowledge than God ordinarily gives
to souls in flesh. I know that I should implicitly,
absolutely, and quietly commit my soul into my
Redeemer's hands; for a distrustful care of the
soul, as well as the body, is our great sin and mis-
ery. Yet we must desire that our knowledge and
belief may be as distinct as divine revelations are.
We can love no farther than we know; and the
more we know of God and glory, the more we
shall love, desire, and trust. If I may not be
ambitious of too sensible and distinct foretastes
of things unseen, yet I must desire and beg the
most fervent love of them of which I am capable,
that my soul may not pass with distrust and terror,
but with suitable triumphant hopes, to everlasting
pleasures. " O Father of lights, who givest wis-
dom to them that ask, shut not up this sinful soul
in darkness ! Leave me not to grope in unsatisfied
doubts, at the door of celestial light ! Deny me
not now the lively exercise of faith, hope, and
love, which are the stirrings of the new creature,
the dawnings of eternal day, and the earnest of the
promised inheritance I" Though, like Cicero's,
after reading Plato's book on immortality, our
doubts return, and our fear interrupts and weakens
our desires and joys ; yet I find that it is chiefly



Chap. III. J ARE WITH CHRIST. 43

an irrational fear, occasioned by the darkness of
the mind, the greatness of the change, the dreadful
majesty of God, and man's natural aversion to
death, even when reason is fully satisfied that such
fear is consistent with certain safety. Were I on
the top of a castle or steeple,, fastened by the \
strongest chains, or guarded by the surest battle-
ments, I could not possibly look down without
fear; and so it is with our prospeetinto the life to
come. If, therefore, my soul sees undeniable evi-
dence of immortality, and is able by irrefragable
arguments to prove a future blessedness ; if I am
convinced that divine promises are true, and trust
my soul and all my hope upon them ; then nei-
ther my averseness to die, nor my irrational fear
of entering upon eternity, can invalidate the rea-
sons of my hope, or prove the unsoundness of my
faith, but only the weakness of it. " Why are ye
fearful, O ye of little faith ?" was Christ's just re-
proof to his disciples. A timorous heart needs to
be chided, by saying, " Why art thou cast down,
O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within
me? Hope thou in God," &c»



CHAPTER XII

What it is to depart, and to be with Christ.

Having proved that faith and hope have a cer-
tain future happiness to expect, the text directs

me next to consider,— What it is to be with Christ;
and — What it is to depart, in order to be with him.

I. To be with Christ, includes — Presence with
him, — Union to him, and — Participation of his
happiness.

1. The presence of Christ, which piousseparate
spirits shall enjoy, must refer to his Godhead as
well as to his human soul and body. We shall
be present with the divine nature of Christ, as
manifested in and by his glory. He teaches us to
pray, " Our Father, which art in heaven," because
in heaven the Father gloriously shines forth to-
holy souls. The soul of man is eminently said
to be in the head, because there it understand*
and reasons; and not in the foot or hand, though
it be also there. As we look a man in the face
when we talk to him, so we look up to heaven
when we pray to God. Though " in God we live,
and move, and have our being," both as the God
of nature and grace, yet by the works and splen-
dor of his glory he is eminently in heaven, man-
ifesting himself there by some created glory; for
his essence is the same every where. We shall
be present with the human nature of Christ, both
soul and body. But here our present narrow
thoughts must not too boldly presume to deter-
mine the difference between Christ's glorified bo-
dy and his flesh upon earth ; nor where his glo-
rified body is nor how far it extends; nor where-
in his soul and his glorified body differ, seeing it



Ch£p. III.] AND TO BE WITH CHRIST. 45

Is called a spiritual body. We can conceive no
more of such a body than that it is pure, in
corruptible, invisible to mortal eyes, and fitted to
he most perfect state of the soul. Nor need we
wonder how a whole world of glorified bodies can
all of them be present with the one body of Christ;
for as the solar beams are so present with the air
that none can discern the difference of the places
which they possess, and a world of bodies are pre-
sent with them both; so may all our bodies, with-
out any confusion, be present with Christ's body.
% The union to Christ, which pious separate
spirits shall also enjoy, must be like that of sub-
jects to their king ; but how much more we know
not. The more spiritual, pure, and noble any na-
tures are, the more inclination they have to union.
Such instances of union, as the vine and branches,
the head and members, are of extensive import ;
yet being but similitudes, we cannot determine
how extensive. Far be it from us to think that
Christ's glorified body is of such an earthly com-
position, and of such a limited extent as it was
here ; for then, as his disciples and a iew more
were present with him, while the rest of the
world were absent and had none of his company,
so it would be in heaven. But all true believers,
from the creation to the end of the world, as well
as a Paul, shall " be with Christ, and see his glo-
ry." And though there will be different degrees
of glory, as there have been of holiness, yet none
in heaven are at such a distance from Christ as
not to enjoy the felicity of his presence.



16 WHAT IT IS TO DEPART, [Chap. Ill

3. We shall also have communion with the di-
vine and human natures of Christ; both which
shall be the felicitating objects of perfect knowledge
and holy love to the separate spirits,, before the
resurrection. The chief part of this communion
will consist in Christ's communications to the
soul. As the whole creation is more dependent on
God than the fruit on the tree, or plant on the
earth, or the members on the body, so God uses
second causes in his communications to inferior
natures ; and it is more than probable that Christ's
human nature is the second cause of communica-
ting both grace and glory, both to man in the bo-
dy and to the separate soul. As the sun is both
the cause and object of sight to the eye, so is
Christ to the soul. For as God, so the Lamb is
the light and glory of the heavenly Jerusalem,
and in his light they chall have light. Though
Christ shall give up the kingdom to the Father,
so that God maybe " all in all," and his creatures
be fully restored to his favor, and a healing gov-
ernment for recovering lapsed souls to God shall
be no more needed; yet surely he will not cease
to be our Mediator, the church's head, and the
channel of everlasting light, life, and love to all
his members. As " we now live because he lives,'
like the branches in the vine; and as the Spirit
that now quickens, enlightens, and sanctifies us,
is first the Spirit of Christ before it is ours, and
is communicated from God through him to us; so
will it be in the state of glory: there our union



Chap. Ill*] AND TO BE WITH CHRIST- 47

and communion with him will be perfected, and
not destroyed or diminished. As it would be ar-
rogance to think we shall be above the need and
use of Christ and his communications ; so, I doubt
not, we shall ever have use for one another, as is
plainly intimated by " sitting down with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of God ;" by be
ing " in Abraham's bosom ;" by " sitting at Christ's
right and left hand in his kingdom ;" by being
" made ruler over ten cities;" and by joining with
those that "sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb "
And certainly if I be " with Christ," I shall be
with all them that are with Christ, even with all
the heavenly society. Our mortal bodies must
have so much room, that the earth is little enough
for all its inhabitants. So narrow is our capacity
of communion here, that those of the antipodes,
or on the opposite side of the earth, are almost
as strange to us as if they were in another world.
What strangers are we to those of another king-
dom, county, or parish, and even of another house.
But we have great cause to think, by many scrip-
tural expressions, that our heavenly union and
communion will be nearer and more extensive,
and that all the glorified shall know each other.
It is, I confess, a pleasant thought to me, and
greatly helps my willingness to die, to think that
I shall go to all the holy ones, both Christ, and
angels, and pious separate spirits. They are each
of them better and more amiable than I am. Ma-
ny are better than one, and the perfect whole

than a sinful part, and the New Jerusalem is the
glory of the creation. God has given me a love
to all that are holy, for their holiness ; and a love
to the work of love and praise, which they con-
tinually and perfectly perform ; and a love to his
celestial habitation, to his glory shining there.
My old acquaintance with many a holy person
gone to Christ, makes my thoughts of heaven the
more familiar to me. O how many of them could
I name ! And it is no small encouragement to
one that is to enter upon an unseen world, to
think that he goes no untrodden path, nor enters
into a solitary or singular state ; but follows all
that, from the creation to this day, have passed by
death into endless life. O how emboldening to
consider that I am to go the same way, and to
the same place and state, with all the believers
and saints that have ever gone before me !

II. But I must " depart before I can thus " be
with Christ." I must particularly depart — from
this body — from all its former delights — and also
from more rational pleasures belonging to the
present life and world.

1. I must depart from this body. Here these
eyes must see no more, this hand move no more,
these feet walk no more, this tongue speak no
more. As much as I have loved, and over-loved
this body, I must leave it to the grave. There
must it lie and rot in darkness, as a neglected and
loathsome thing. This is the fruit of sin, and Ha-



Chap. 1II.1 AND TO BE WITH CHRIST. 49

ture would not have it so. But it is only my shell,
my tabernacle, my clothing, and not my soul itself.
It is only a dissolution ; earth to earth. It is but
an instrument laid by, when all its work is done ;
a servant dismissed, when his service is enced ;
as I cast by my lute when I have better employ-
ment. It is but as flowers die in autumn, and
plants in winter. It is but a separation from a
troublesome companion, and putting off a shoe
that pinched me. Many a sad and painful hour,
many a weary night and day, have I had. What
cares and fears, what griefs and groans, has this
body cost me ! Alas ! how much of my precious
time has been spent to maintain, please, or repair
it ! Often have I thought that it cost me so dear
to live, yea, to live a painful weary life, that were
it not for the higher ends of life, I had little rea-
son to be much in love with it, or be loth to leave
it. To depart from such a body, is but to remove
from a sordid habitation. I know it is the curious
wonderful work of God, and not to be despised
or unjustly dishonored, but admired and well
used ; yet our reason wonders that so noble a
spirit should be so meanly housed, for we must
call it " our vile body." To depart from such a
body, is but to be " loosed from the bondage of
corruption," from the clog and prison of the soul.
That body, which was a fit servant to the soul of
innocent man, is now become as a prison. And
further, to depart from such a body, is but to be
separated from an accidental enemy, and one of

5 Dying Thoughts.



50 WHAT IT IS TO D I. PART, | Chap. Ill

our greatest and most hurtful enemies ; not, in-
deed, as the work of our Creator, but as the effect
of sin. What could Satan, or any other enemy
of our souls, have done against us without our
flesh? What is it but the interest of this body
that stands in competition with the interest of
God and our souls? What else do the profane
sell their heavenly inheritance for, as Esau his
birthright? W'hat else is the bait of ambition,
covetousness, and sensuality ? What takes up
the thoughts and cares which we should lay out
upon things spiritual and heavenly, but this body
and its life ? What steals away men's hearts from
the heavenly pleasures of faith, hope, and love,
but the pleasures of this flesh ? This draws us to
sin, and hinders us from and in our duty. Were
it not for bodily interests and temptations, how
much more innocent and' holy might I live! I
bhould have nothing to care for, but to please
God and be pleased in him, were it not for the
rare of this bodily life. What employment should
my will and love have but to delight in God, and
love him and his interest, were it not for the love
of the body and its concerns? By this the mind
is darkened, the thoughts diverted, our wills cor-
rupted, our heart and time alienated from God,
our guilt increased, our heavenly desires and hopes
destroyed ; life is made unholy and uncomfortable,
and death terrible. God and souls are separated,
and eternal life is neglected and in danger of be-
ing utterly lost. I know that in all this the sin-



Chap. III.] AND TO BE WITH CHRIST. 51

fol soul is tiie chief cause and agent : but is not
bodily interest its temptation, bait, and end ? Is
not the body, and its life and pleasure, the chief
illuring cause of all this sin and misery? And
shall I take such a body to be better than heaven,
or refuse to be loosed from so troublesome a yoke-
fellow, and separated from so burdensome and
dangerous a companion?

2. I must depart from all the former pleasures
of this body. I must taste no more sweetness in
meat or drink, in rest or action, or any such thing
as now delights me. Houses and lands, goods and
Wealth must all be left; and the place where I live
must know me no more. All I labored for, or
took delight in, must be no more to me than if
they had never been. But consider, O my soul!
Thy former pleasures are already past. Thou
losest none of them by death, for they af'e all lost
before; unless immortal grace has made them im-
mortal by sanctifying them. All that death does
to them is to prevent the repetition of them upon
earth. Is not the pleasure which .we lose by death
common to every brute? Meat is as sweet to
them, and ease as welcome, and appetite as vehe-
ment. Why then should it seem hard to us to
lose that, when God pleases, which we deprive
the brutes of at our pleasure ? If we are believ-
ers, we only exchange these delights of life for
the greater delights of a life with Christ; a com-
fort which our fellow-creatures the brutes have

He indeed returned to the glory he had with
the Father before the world was, John 17:5,
yet after he was raised from the dead, Luke
24 : 39-43 ; John 20 : 27, and when he ascended
on high, Acts 1:11, he was a man still, the
same Jesus.

Having passed through the heavens as our
forerunner, Heb. 6 : 20, he is now the sympathi-
zing Man, Heb. 4:14-16, at the right hand of
God as an intercessor, Heb. 9:24; 10:12, on
behalf of those whom he is not ashamed to call
his brethren, Heb. 2 : 11, 12.

Finally, when about to give his last message
to the churches, he even then revealed himself,
as "for evermore " alive from the dead, Rev.
1 : 13-18; while he is yet to be manifested be-
fore all the ransomed church of God, even in
the midst of the throne, still bearing the marks
of his crucifixion, a Lamb "as it had been slain,"
Rev. 5:6.

Thus the salvation which is from God is given
to men in a Saviour who is both God and man
in one person for ever. In his own person he
is able to stand for God among men and for

men before God, divinely constituted to be a
Mediator, i Tim. 2:5; Heb. 12:24, cf. Gal.
3:20.

In Him the invisible God became visible and
tangible, 1 John 1 : 1-3 ; Matt. 11 127, 28; and
the sinner is not only drawn by the cords of a
man, but also in seeing and knowing Him, sees
and knows the Father also, John 14:7-9; for
in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead
bodily, Col. 2 : 9.

But in him, on the other hand, God finds
the man in whom he can delight, Matt. 3 : 1 5—
17; Acts 2:22, and worthy to be exalted above
every name, Phil. 2:9; and in him, whosoever
will may find a second Adam, or head of the
race, through whom God can bestow righteous-
ness and life and incorruption in abounding
grace, even as through the first Adam we have
all been visited with sin and death, Rom.
5 : 12-20; 1 Cor. 15 :22, 45. While the surpass-
ing love and the treasures of wisdom and knowl-
edge which are wrapped in the fathomless marvel
of his person, will take the ages of eternity for
their unfolding, Eph. 3:19;. Col. 2:3; Eph. 2 : 7.



THE WORK OF CHRIST. 37

SALVATION.
3. THE WORK OF CHRIST.

But the climax of the marvel of Christ's in-
carnation and spotless life was his death. The
Son of God became man in order to offer him-
self a sacrifice for sin, John 1 : 1-29. He, who
knew no sin, voluntarily humbled himself, John
10:17, 18, to take the place of a sinner before
God's broken law, Phil. 2 : 5-8 ; Gal. 4:4; Mark
15 :28. The Prince of glory died in agony and
shame upon the cross, Luke 23 146; Heb. 12 : 2.
But beyond his shameful rejection by men,
Matt. 27 : 22-44, an d beyond all the torture of
his crucifixion, John 19 : 28, there was in his
death a fathomless depth of anguish, Matt.
27:45, 46, to be accounted for only by the
judicial act of a righteous God upon a sin-
bearer, Isaiah 53:6; Zech. 13 : 7. It is a re-
vealed fact that the spotless One was made sin,
2 Cor. 5:21; that the Beloved of God was made
a curse, Gal. 3:13.

But we need to distinguish (2 Tim. 2:15) be-
tween the relation of the death of Christ to the



38 GOSPEL TRUTH.

race, as offering to the world the gift of salva-
tion, and the value of that death to believers,
as bestowing redemption, forgiveness and right-
eousness.

(i.) AS SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD.

The death of Christ has a world-wide relation,
John 3 : 14-2 1 ; 4 : 42 ; 6 : 5 1 ; Titus 2:11. It
is written, " Behold the Lamb of God which ta-
keth away the sin of the world/' John 1 129. As
such he not only glorified God by his spotless
and unblemished manhood, but also by his death,
by which he magnified the law, Isa. 42 : 21, so
that the door to God's mercy is justly thrown
wide open. In this aspect of the atonement, to
use the phrases of one whose expositions of the
Word have been greatly blessed to Christians,
it was not a question of the persons or of the
sins which were to be forgiven, nor of God's
counsels of grace, Eph. 1:4, 5, for God has a
distinct portion in the death of Christ as meet-
ing all his claims — the claims of his nature, his
character, and his throne — in a world that has
disregarded them and dishonored him. And



THE WORK OF CHRIST. 39

thus, as "the Lord's lot," as "God's Lamb," all
aside from the fact that men are saved by it, he
has glorified God before the universe by this dis-
play of his love and righteousness. Thus did he
fulfil the types of the Lord's lot and the slain
bird, Lev. 16 : 8, 9, 15 ; 14 : 4-7.

He gave up all that he had to buy the field
which held the treasure, Matt. 13:44; which
"field is the world," Matt. 13:38. He was a
"ransom for all," 1 Tim. 2:4-6; "a propitia-
tion* not for our sins only but for the whole
world," I John 2:2.

Thus, whether men believe it or not, whether
men avail themselves of it or not, the great fact
is heralded of God to all the world, that there is
a mercy-seat, a meeting-place for God and sin-
ful man as such, upon which and before which
the blood of a perfect and ample atonement has
been sprinkled.

This accounts for the gospel statements that
are without limitations, such as that the Just

* Two different Greek words are translated " propitiation."
The "propitiation" in Rom. 3:25 is rendered "mercy-seat"
in Heb. 9:5; and upon it the "propitiation" or mercy offer-
ing of 1 John 2 : 2, and 4:10, has been sprinkled.



4 o GOSPEL TRUTH.

One suffered " for the unjust," i Pet. 3:18;
that Christ "died for the ungodly," Rom. 5:6;
that he came into the world " to save sinners,"
1 Tim. 1:15. There is therefore nothing in God
or in the sacrifice to hinder its universal accep-
tation, 1 Tim. 1:15; and God's "whosoever"
rings at the door of every man's conscience.

(2.) AS UNTO THE BELIEVER.
(A.) REDEMPTION.

This very gospel to the world is God's chosen
power to bring men to himself, 1 Pet. 3:18. To
it every man ought to give the assent of his
whole soul, because it is true. He who dis-
believes, thereby charges God with falsehood,
1 John 5:10; and remaining alienated from God
abides under condemnation, John 3:18, 36. He
who believes is at once in Christ Jesus made
nigh unto God by the blood of Christ, Eph.
2:13. Having taken his place as a sinner be-
fore the mercy-seat, in the light that shines
there he sees his own sin and the value of the
sacrifice as he never could before. Personally
confessing that he is one of those who like



THE WORK OF CHRIST 41

sheep have gone astray, he is also constrained
to see that he is one of those whose sins have
by a priestly act been laid upon Christ, Isaiah
53:6.

The second of the two parables in Matt.
13 : 44-46, now finds its counterpart to him in
Matt. 20 : 28 ; Eph. 5 : 25-27 ; Titus 2 : 14. In
these passages the purchase is not of a mere
privilege — that the Son of Man may seek for
treasure, Matt. 13 144, and the Father may seek
for worshippers, John 4 : 23 ; or that man as
such may come to God through a mediator,
1 Tim. 2 : 4-6 — but of the persons of believers,
1 Cor. 6 : 20; a finished transaction, 1 Pet. 1:18,
19; Rev. 5:9, by which they are redeemed
from under the curse and slavery of sin, Gal.
3:13; Rom. 7 : 14, 23 — 8 : 1, and have become
his purchased possession, Eph. 1 : 14, for his
exclusive service, Rom. 6 : 22 ; 12 : 1 ; 1 Cor.
10 : 31, and especial glory, Isa. 53:12; 2 Thess.
1 : 10-12 ; Jude 24. Instructed by these Scrip--
tures the believer comes to know with assurance
that he possesses the manifold benefits of the
one death of Christ as figured in the varied

G

aspects of the many offerings given to Israel.
He should now apply to himself the family per-
sonal pronouns of the epistles, e. g. Rom. 4 : 25 ;
5:1; 1 Cor. 1 : 30 ; 2 : 9-16 ; 15 : 51-54 ; 2 Cor.
5 : 1-9, 18, 21 ; Gal. 2 120; Eph. 1 : 3-7; 2:4-10 ;
4:30; 5:2, 8; Col. 1 : 12, 13; 2:6, 7, 10;
3:1-5; Jas. 1:18; 1 Pet. 2 : 24 ; 1 John 1 : 7,
9; 3 : 1-3; 4: 10, 11, 16, 17; Rev. 1:5,6.

(b.) forgiveness.

Nothing of all that the believer possesses
through the death of Christ should be more
clearly discerned than that he now has the for-
giveness of sins, Eph. 4 : 32 ; Col. 3:13.

As the scapegoat typically took upon its head
" all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and
all their transgressions in all their sins," as con-
fessed by the high priest, so particularly also
has the Lord Jesus assumed upon himself all
the sins of these who come unto God by Him.
And even as the scapegoat was "let go" into
the wilderness never to be seen again ; as it
bore away its heavy load "into a land not inhab-
ited" — a land of separation, (margin,) a land



THE WORK OF CHRIST. 43

inaccessible (Septuagint) — so Christ also has
borne away the believer's iniquities into the
realm of God's forgetfulness. His transgres-
sions have been so let go and banished that in
God's sight he is entirely separated from all
that he has ever been and done, Lev. 16: 10,
21, 22; cf. Lev. 14:6, 7. Thus wonderfully do
even Old Testament types picture out the
riches of the grace according to which the be-
liever possesses the forgiveness of sins, Eph.
1:7.

All Scripture combines to set forth in figure
and statement its fulness and completeness.
" As far as the east is from the west, so far hath
he removed our transgressions from us," Psa.
103 : 12. He has cast our sins behind his back,
Isa. 38 : 17. He has buried them in the depths
of the sea, Micah 7 : 19. Their record is blotted
out, Isa. 43 : 25, and their remission is as abso-
lute as the cancelling of a debt which has been
settled by another, Matt. 6:12; Acts 10:43;

13:38, 39-

The scarlet, crimson stains which human
chemistry cannot bleach, are, through grace,



44 GOSPEL TRUTH,

washed white in the sight of God, Isa. I : 18;
i John 1:7; Rev. 7 : 14.

And since with God there is not even the
remembrance of his sins, every believer may,
through the blood of Jesus, draw near; yes, is
bidden of God to come, in the full assurance of a
present possession of forgiveness, Heb. 10: 17-
22. He has not to wait for it as a future inher-
itance ; it is his already, (note the tenses of Eph.
1 :7; 4 132 ; Col. 1 : 12-14; 3 : 13,) even though
he be a babe in Christ, 1 John 2:12.

(C) RIGHTEOUSNESS.

The forgiveness of the gospel is more than
deliverance from the penalty of the law. It is
" the forgiveness of sins." The gospel, accord-
ingly, goes on to declare that God is righteous
in the justification of him that believeth in
Jesus, Rom. 1 : 16, 17 ; 3 : 26.

As a sinner he is reckoned to have already so
died in the death of Christ for him, Rom. 6 : 3-
n; 7 : 4, 6, margin ; Gal. 2 : 19, 20 ; Col. 3:3;
1 Pet. 2 : 24, that in God's sight all that he was
and had done is entirely cleared from connec-



THE WORK OF CHRIST. 45

tion with him, 2 Cor. 5 : 14-18 ; 1 Pet. 4:1, 2 ;
1 John 3 : 5.

As redeemed unto God, the believer is now
absolutely His, John 17 : 2, 6, 10 ; 1 Cor. 6 : 19,
20; Gal. 1:4; Titus 2:14; so that God can
righteously do with him as love may dictate,
Eph. 1 : 3-6, and in unfettered grace exalt him
into union with his Son, John 17 : 21-23 \ l Cor.
1:9, and upon him, as risen from the dead,
lavish untold blessings, Eph. 2 : 4-10 ; 3 : 20,
21.

Christ in his death was not the "sin-offering"
and the " trespass-offering" only; he was also
for the believer all the "sweet-savor offerings,"
Lev. 1-3 ; Eph. 5 : 2 — " the offerings for accept-
ance"* — so that God is justified, in view of
the cross, in bestowing righteousness upon him
and in accepting him in the acceptableness of
Christ, 1 John 4:17; Eph. 5 : 29, 30 ; 1 Cor.
12: 12, 27; Col. 3:3, 4.

Accordingly, the righteousness which the be-

* The original Hebrew in Lev. 1 : 3, for "of his own volun-
tary will," should be rendered, "for his acceptance," and in
verse 4 is translated " accepted for him."



46 GOSPEL TRUTH.

liever has before God* is seen to be not by
works of the law, but apart from law, Rom.
3 : 19-21, 28; 4 : 3-6 ; 10 : 3-10; Gal. 2: 16, 19,
2 1 ; Phil, 3:9)2 Tim. 1:9; Heb. 11:4; Titus
3 : 5-7, and not even by the faith of the believer
as itself a good work, Rom. 3 : 24, but by the
blood of Christ, Rom. 5 :'g; Gal. 3 : 1-14, in the
work of redemption, Rom. 3 : 24 ; 4 : 23-25 ; 5:9,
10, 18, 19 ; 8 : 33, 34 ; 2 Cor. 5 : 18-21.

It is therefore entirely a righteousness from
God, Phil. 3:9; 1 Cor. 1 : 30 ; for the unworthy,
Rom. 3 124; 4:5, 16; 5 :6-io, 15, 16, 21 ; Gal.
2:21; Titus 3 : 3-7 ; by grace, unto all and upon
all who believe, Rom. 1:16, 17 ; 3 : 22 ; 5:1;
10:4, 10; Phil. 3 :g.

It is moreover justification in a person, and
not merely through a plan of redemption. It is
" in Christ " that we become the righteousness of
God, 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Cor. 1 : 30 ; 1 Cor. 6:11;
Acts 13 .'39 ;f Gal. 2: 17 ;f Jer. 23 :6.

* James speaks of a righteousness by works which Abra-
ham had "before men," and which showed his righteousness
by faith to be real, not merely professed, and alive, not dead.
James 2 : 14-26 cf. Rom. 4 : 2.

f The "by him" and "by Christ" are literally "in him"
and "in Christ."



SAL VATION B Y GRACE. 47

The issue under the leading of the Spirit of
God, is in the works and fruits of righteousness,
Phil. 1 : 1 1 ; Rom. 7:6; 8:4; Gal. 5:23-25;
Eph. 5:9; Col. 1:6, 10; 3 : 5—17 ; Tit. 2 : 12-14;
1 John 2 : 29 ; 3:7; Rev. 7 : 14 with 19 : 8.

But what the believer is, as created after God
in the righteousness and holiness of truth, Eph.
4:24;- — what he is because Christ, of God, is
made unto him righteousness, 1 Cor. 1 : 30, can-
not be fully seen till resurrection, 1 John 3 :2.

4. SALVATION BY GRACE.

Plainly, since man is guilty, Rom. 3 : 19, lost,
Luke 19:10, condemned already, John 3:18,
and dead in trespasses and sins,^ Eph. 2:1;
Rom. 8:6, 7, there is nothing he can do to earn
salvation or commend himself to God. And as
plainly, since Christ came into the world to save
sinners, 1 Tim. 1:15, and finished the work
God gave him to do, John 17:4; 19:30, so that
he is able to completely save all who come unto
God by him, Heb. 7 : 25, there is no work the
sinner needs to do, no fitness he needs to seek,
in order that he may receive salvation.



48 GOSPEL TRUTH.

He has not to win God's love ; for God al-
ready loves him, as testified in the gift of his
Son, John 3 : 16; 1 John 4:9, 10.

The sinner has not to persuade God to be
merciful* and willing to save him ; God, already
more than willing to save, Ezek, 33:11; 2 Pet.
3:9; 1 Tim. 2:4, has been merciful, and is
beseeching him to accept salvation, 2 Cor. 5 : 20.

No emotions or experiences are to be sought,
to make it right for God to save the sinner,
Rom. 10: 3, 6-8 ; God has already made it right,
through the death of his Son, Rom. 3 : 19-26.
To a perfect offering nothing can be added,
Heb. 10: 1-18.

The sinner has no money or price of any sort
to pay, Isa, 55:1-3, for God has already pur-
chased salvation, that he may make it a free
gift, Rom. 5 : 1 5-1 8 ; 6:23; Eph. 2 : 8.

* The publican's prayer, Luke 18: 13, was literally "God
make a propitiation for me a sinner ;" and he was justified be-
cause he rested, not in anything connected with himself, but
in a propitiation which God should make, cf. Rom. 3 : 25. But
to now offer this prayer, instead of accepting the reconciliation
(Greek, propitiation) God has made, Heb. 2 : 17, is to ignore
the great fact of the Gospel, that Christ has died. See note
on propitiation, page 39.



SAL VA T10N B Y GRACE, 49

There is in salvation no mixture of grace and
works, God doing his part and we doing our
part, Rom. 4:4, 5; 11:6. God does all the
providing and giving, 2 Tim. 1:9, 10; Titus
3:3-7; the sinner, in order to salvation, can
only receive, 1 John 5 : 11-13.

The believer is, indeed, called to a holy life,
1 Pet. 1 :i5, 16; Eph. 4:17-24, and has much
to do for God because he is saved, Rom. 12:1;
1 Cor. 6:20; 15 : 10; 2 Cor. 5 : 14, 15 ; yet the sin-
ner, as an unbeliever, has nothing to do before
accepting Christ, John 6 :28, 29; Acts 16 : 30, 31.

He has not to wait for a favorable opportuni-
ty, for God declares that now is the accepted
time and the day of salvation, 2 Cor. 6:2;
Heb. 3:7, 8. All things are now ready, Luke
14:17.

As simply and really and immediately as one
accepts any gift, so simply and really and im-
mediately must the sinner accept the gift of
God, Rev. 22 : 17.



5o GOSPEL TRUTH.

5. SALVATION THROUGH REPENTANCE.

From the testimony already before us, no self-
reformation, no protracted agony of soul, no
mere sorrowing over sin, nor anything whatever
which the sinner works out for himself, need be
first experienced, before he can accept salvation
as the gift of God. Repentance, therefore, while
often accompanied by these and similar experi-
ences, must be something different, wrought in
the soul by receiving the facts of the gospel.

Accordingly repentance unto life, Acts 11:18,
is, in the Bible, that change of mind,* in which

* The Greek word for repentance, occurring in the New
Testament fifty-seven times, is literally an "after-mind." John
the Baptist preached to God's ancient people that change of
mind necessary to the reception of their promised Messiah,
Matt. 3 : 2, 3. Jesus preached to them that change of mind
which should accept him in his humiliation, Matt. 4:17, .23;
5 : 3, 10. Peter preached to them that change of mind which
should accept Him whom they had Crucified as both Lord and
Christ, Acts 2 : 36-38. In each case repentance was coming
into an after-mind.

Another word, occurring only five times in the Greek New
Testament, is translated in our version " repent," which strictly
means an " after-sorrow," and which may be simply " regret,"
as in 2 Cor. J :8 ; or maybe " remorse," as in Matt. 27 : 3, a
sorrow of the world which worked death, cf. 2 Cor. 7 : 10. But



REPENTANCE UNTO SALVATION 51

one, instructed by the gospel, acknowledges
the truth, 2 Tim. 2 : 25, concerning himself,
Isa. 6 : 5 ; Job 42 : 5, 6; Matt. 12 141, and con-
cerning God, Acts 17:23-25, 29, 30; so that,
forsaking his own ways and giving up his own
thoughts, Isa. 55:7-9; 2 Kings 5:11-14, he
comes to God through Christ, and believes the
gospel, Acts 20 : 21 ; Mark 1 : 14, 15 ; Luke
24 : 46, 47.

A man repents when, instead of justifying
himself, Luke 1.6 : 15, he turns and confesses his
sins, Luke 18:9-11, cf. Luke 7:29 and Psa.
51 : 3, 4 ; and instead of esteeming them lightly,
is convinced of their exceeding sinfulness, Rom.
7 : 7—13 ; and instead of making excuses, listens
to God's invitations, Luke 14:16-24; and in-
stead of doubting God's love, believes it, 1 John
4:16; and instead of rejecting God's gift, ac-
cepts it, 1 John 5 :9-i2.

A man repents when he turns from resting
upon anything in himself, because he sees noth-

this "after-sorrow," as in Matt. 21 * 29, 32, may also result in
the "repentance unto salvation'* that does not need to be
changed, 2 Cor. 7 : 10.



52 GOSPEL TRUTH.

ing there upon which he can rest, and begins to
rest entirely upon Christ, Luke 5:32; 1 Cor.
3:11; when, instead of bringing anything he
has done as an offering to God, he finds he has
done nothing worthy to be offered, and brings
only what Christ has done, Gen. 4 : 2-7, cf. Heb.
11:4; Gen. 22:8; John 1 : 29 ; Heb. 10 : 8-10,
18, 26 ;* when he suffers himself to be brought
home to God through the Shepherd's work,
through the gospel that has sought him out in
his sins, and through the fact that in the Fa-
ther s house there is bread enough and to spare,
Luke 15. See particularly verses 7, 10, 17.

It is therefore the goodness of God that leads
to repentance, Rom. 2:4; and repentance unto
life is turning to God in Christ, from self and
sin, " to servef the living and true God, and to

* The Greek in Heb. 10 : 18, 26 for "no more " offering, " no
more" sacrifice, has the force of "no different,'' "no addi-
tional " offering or sacrifice.

t While therefore reformation is not repentance, true; re-
pentance will always manifest itself in a life of service and
devotion to God, Matt. 3:8; Acts 26: 20.

It must further be remembered that repentance has been
here set forth only as related to the sinner's conversion. The
believer, in his advancing knowledge of the will of God, will



SAL VA TION THR O UGH FAITH. 53

wait for his Son from heaven," Acts 26:20;
1 Thess. 1 19, 10.

Accordingly the message which declares the
fulness of the work of Christ for sinners demands
an immediate repentance, to the acceptance of
the gospel, Mark 1 : 14, 15 ; Luke 24 \^j ; Acts
17:30.

6. SALVATION THROUGH FAITH,
(i.) REPENTANCE AND FAITH.

Repentance unto life, as thus set forth from
the Scriptures, plainly involves faith ; and faith
equally involves repentance. They are not
two separable acts of the soul, but so blended,
that faith is the very heart of repentance. Re-
pentance describes the turning from self as
well as the turning to God ; faith brings before
the mind especially the coming to God. Re-
pentance is the change of a man's mind from
the conviction and life which he holds by na-
ture, to the convictions and life wrought by the
gospel. Faith is his simple and hearty reception

be led again and again to repentance, which will also show
itself in a changed life, 2 Cor. 7 :8-n.



S4 GOSPEL TRUTH.

of the truth, the reliance upon Christ to which
the gospel has brought him.

(2.) FAITH IN GENERAL SAVING FAITH.

Accordingly, in the Bible, faith in general is
defined as " the assurance of things hoped for,
the conviction of things not seen/' Heb. 11 : 1,
Greek. In its simplest form it is belief in the
testimony of another, 1 John 5 :g, and comes by
hearing, Gal. 3:2; Rom. 10 : 17 ; Isa. 55:3. It
is taking God at his word, Rom. 4 : 20, 21.

The faith, therefore, that saves, Acts 16:30,
31, is no arbitrary requirement of God, to be
first fulfilled as a condition, entitling one to
receive eternal life, but is itself the very act of
receiving the salvation God has provided and
given, Eph. 2:8. It is the single act of taking
one's place behind the blood of the passover
lamb, which, though sprinkled upon the door-
posts and lintel, can be no protection to those
who remain outside its shelter, Exod. 12. It is
simply listening to the message of the gospel,
which, however true and widely proclaimed, can-
not produce any effect except it be heard, Isa,



FAITH IN GENERAL. 55

55:1-3; Matt. 13:9, 12-16. It is only receiv-
ing the light, which, however clearly it shines
from the uplifted Christ, cannot enlighten nor
heal one who keeps his eyes shut and face turned
away, Numb. 21 : 8, 9; John 3 : 14, 18-21 ; 12 : 32,
33/ 35> 36, 46-48. It is really drinking in the
water of life, which, however freely it flows,
can no otherwise quench the thirst, Isa. 55 : 1 ;
John 4: 14; 6:35; 7 : 37; Rev, 22 : 17. It is
merely taking in the seed which, however vital,
cannot spring up into life except it be honestly
received into the heart. Luke 8:5-15; John
6 : 63 ; 1 Pet. 1 : 23.

Thus salvation which is entirely by grace
must be by faith, Rom. 4 : 16 ; Eph. 2 : 5, 8 ; and
the faith essential to salvation, Luke 7:50; 8 : 48,
50 ; John 6 : 28, 29 ; Rom. 3 : 2 1-26 ; 5:1; 10:9,
10, instead of being an arbitrary requirement, is,
in the nature of things, necessary, just as a gift
can be accepted only through believing the tes-
timony of the giver when he declares that he
gives it, 1 John 5 :g-io.



56 GOSPEL TRUTH.

(3.) THE TESTIMONY TO BE BELIEVED.

The attention of the sinner must therefore be
directed, not to his own faith, or to any process
of his own mind, but to the testimony of God*
by which salvation is given.

God has declared man's need and sin and
danger in unmistakable terms. The very rec-
ord that testifies man's utter ruin, has declared
that there is salvation for him from God. God
has revealed his love in the gift of his Son. He
has made him to be an offering for sin. Seated
now in righteousness upon a throne of mercy,
he declares the way entirely open, and invites
the weary and sin-laden to come to him through
the Mediator he has provided. He proclaims
pardon for the unworthy through the death of
his Son. He declares that every one who comes
to him, through the sacrifice of the Lamb he
has himself provided, is for ever redeemed, for-

* To set forth this testimony in its various parts, separately
and at length, has been the endeavor in the preceding pages.
To them the reader is directed, in the testimony as summed up
in this and in the following section, for the Scripture referen-
ces to every sentence without one.



THE DECISIVE QUESTION, 57

given, and justified. He declares that every
one who believes this testimony, is at once in
possession of salvation. Behind every one of
these statements is the character of God who
cannot lie, Rom. 3:4; Titus 1 : 1-3 ; Heb.
6:16-18.

(4.) THE DECISIVE QUESTION.

Therefore the whole question now at issue
between God and the sinner, upon which his
possession of salvation hinges, is the hearty ac-
ceptance of these declarations as true, John
3:18; Mark 16: 15, 16.

Will he confess himself a sinner, lost and un-
done ? Will he open his eyes to the fact, that
God loves him and has salvation for him ? Will
he bow to the revelation that God, in the death
of Christ, has done everything requisite in order
to bestow salvation ? Will he accept it as a
reality, that God has given him His Son and
eternal life in Him, and be at peace with God ?
Will he see Jesus to be his Saviour ? and will
he, as reconciled to God, seeing that Jesus, His
own self, bore his sins in His own body on the tree,



5 8 GOSPEL TRUTH.

with his whole soul bow to Christ as his Lord,
who has redeemed him unto Himself, and to
whom his whole heart and life and service must
belong ?

At every step the single question is, will the
sinner take God at his word ?

If he receives the testimony, in believing,
Rom. 15 : 13, he enters into possession of salva-
tion and of all the blessings which flow from
Christ's death, John 3:16, 36; 5:24; 20:31;
Eph. 1 : 3-7 ; 1 John 5:1, 5, 12, and yet, in it
all, has simply set to his seal that God is true,
John 3:31-33.

(5.) WHAT UNBELIEF INVOLVES.

If he rejects the testimony, he does nothing
less than make God a liar, 1 John 5 : 10. In set-
ting aside God's words, Zech. 7:12; Acts. 26 : 28,
he denies his own sin and need, John 8 140-45 ;
Luke 18:11, 12, denies that Christ and his
death have any personal relation to him, Acts
13 : 45, 46, and denies that there is any gift of
salvation for him.

Shutting his eyes to the testimony that there



WHAT UNBELIEF IN VOL VES. 59

is none other name under heaven, given among
men, whereby he must be saved, Acts 4:12, that
other foundation can no man lay than that is
laid, which is Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 3:11, that if
righteousness come by the law, Christ died in
vain, Gal. 2 :2i, that without shedding of blood
there is no remission of sins, Heb. 9:22, that
no man cometh unto the Father if not by Christ,
John 14:6; 1 Tim, 2:5, that into heaven shall
in no wise enter any whose names are not writ-
ten in the Lamb's book of life, Rev. 21 : 27, he
refuses to recognize Christ as his Saviour and
his Lord, John 1 :n ; Luke 20: 14, 15, rebels
against His word and authority,. Luke 19:14,
and persists in obdurate alienation from God
and enmity toward Him, John 5 : 40 ; Eph. 4:17-
19, and further makes God a liar by still hoping
to be happy.

Resisting all the messages of the Holy Spirit,
he does despite to His grace ; and unmoved by
the love of God, which at such inestimable cost
has sought to win him from his sin and bring
him to Himself, he tramples upon the Son of God
and puts him to an open shame, Heb. 6 :6; 10:29.



6o GOSPEL TRUTH.

Surely, as the Scripture itself declares, noth-
ing but the folly and madness, Gal. 3 : 1, which
suffers itself to be duped and blinded by Satan,
2 Cor. 4 : 2-4, nothing but ineradicable hatred
to God, John 7 :y ; 15:18, 19, 22-25, could per-
sist in such a course ; and he who does so must
abide under the wrath of God, John 3 : 36.

7. THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN REGEN-
ERATION.

God the Holy Spirit, Acts 5:3,4; Matt.
28 : 19; 2 Cor. 13 : 14 ; 1 Cor. 2 : 10, 11 ; 3 : 16,
the author of the Scriptures, 1 Cor. 2: 13, 14;
Acts 1:16; 28 : 25 ; Heb. 3:7; 9 : 7, 8 ; 10 : 15 ;
1 Pet. 1 : 10-12 ; 2 Pet. 1 : 21, is, at every step,
the author also of salvation, John 3:5; 7 : 37-
39; 15:26; 16:7-15; 14:16,17,26; 1 Cor.
12:3; 2 Cor. 3 : 18 ; Rom. 8:11.

Himself unseen, He is behind every declara-
tion of the gospel, energizing and vitalizing the
Word, John 6:63; Acts 2:4; 4:31; 1 Peter
1 : 12, 22.

He designedly remains invisible, that Christ
alone may be held up before the unbeliever and



REGENERATION. 61

revealed in the believer, John 14:17; 15:26;
16: 13-15 ; Rom. 5 : 5 ; 1 Cor. 12 : 3—1 1 ; 1 John

4:i3.

The testimony of the necessity of the new

birth is used in the Scripture, not to turn the
eye from the work of Christ to any working of
the Spirit within the heart, but to take from ev-
ery man the last vestige of a hope that he may
be saved through any goodness or self develop-
ment of his own, John 3 : 1-8 ; cf. Rom. 8 : 5-9.

The sinner is, by Christ himself, turned from
the process of the new birth and directed to look
at the cross, John 3 : g— t 5 ; 12 : 32, 33.

In being born anew he has consciously to do,
not with the Spirit himself, but with the words
of the Spirit by whom he is begotten, John 6 : 63 ;

1 Pet. 1 : 23 ; Jas. 1:18; 2 Pet. 1 : 4. Thus the
word itself, which the Spirit uses, is a helper in
the new birth, John 3 : 5, the water of the Word,
Psa. 119:9 ; John 13 :6-io; 15:3; Eph. 5 125-
27 ; Titus 3 : 5, the water of life, Isa. 55 : 1-3,
10, 1 1 ; John 4 : 10-14, which is the word of life,
John 5 :24 ; 20 : 31 ; Acts 10:22, 43 ; 11 : 14;

2 Tim. 3 : 15. And he who sets aside the testi-



62 GOSPEL TRUl^H.

mony of the Word, therein rejects Christ and
resists the Holy Spirit, Gen. 6:3 ; Acts 7:51.

Even as in the material creation the Spirit
brooded over chaos, and life was created by the
Word that spoke light, Gen. 1 : 1-3, 11, 24, 27;
Job 33 '.4; John 1:3-5; 12:46-50; 2 Cor. 4:6;
so the Spirit has come into and is brooding over
a ruined world, energizing the words which give
light and life ; and he who believes is made alive
from the death in trespasses and sins, Rom.
6:4-13; 8:2; Eph. 2:5, is a new creation,
a new creature, Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17; Eph.
2:10; 4 : 24 ; Col. 3 : 10, and has been born
again, or from above, John 3:3; 1 Pet. 1 :23 ;
Jas. 1:18.

Thus as the grape-vine, John 15:1, natural
bread, John 6:32—35, etc., are figures of which
Christ is the reality, so the new birth is no
figure of speech, but a divine reality, of which
the natural birth is the figure. This is evident
from the minute detail concerning the new
birth. 1. There is a begetting, cf. Matt. 1:2;
Luke 1:35; John 1:13; 3:3, etc. 2. There are
children " begotten, " Greek "tekna," Scotch



RE GENERA TION. 63

" bairns," literally " born ones," see Rom. 8 : 16, and
the argument founded upon the fact in verse
17. 3. There is, in 1 John 2 : 29-3 : 3, a distinct
statement, that in order to truly call us " born
ones " or children, he " begat us out from" him-
self. 4. Accordingly, and as matter of fact, there
is no warrant for the word ''adoption," as used
in the English version. Wherever found, there
is no thought of transfer, and the Greek word
for it should be rendered " sonship." By birth
we are put into the position of heirs, Rom.
8:15,23; 9:4; Gal. 4:5; Eph. 1:5. 5. There
is a seed used to communicate life, 1 Pet. 1 123.
6. Through its reception one becomes a partaker
of the divine nature, 2 Pet. 1:4. 7. God's chil-
dren are always born *' babes" and expected
to grow and reach maturity, 1 Pet. 2:2; Heb.
5 : 1 1—1*4. Certainly Christ did not come to reveal
a figure of speech, John 1 : 18 ; and, as really as the
child Jesus was conceived by the power of the
Holy Spirit, so really is the believer born of the
Spirit of God, cf. Luke 1 : 28—38 and John 3.

While the believer is, by spiritual birth, made
in reality a partaker of the divine nature, 2 Pet.



64 GOSPEL TRUTH.

1:4; 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:26, the testimony
further is explicit, that this does not transform
or remove the carnal nature which he has by
human birth : but that the two, existing together
in him, John 3 :6, are radically opposed the one
to the other, Rom. 7:14-25; 8:5-7; Gal.
5 : 16-25 i 6:7, 8. The believer accordingly is
called practically to identify himself with his
new nature, by submitting himself in every part
of his experience and action to the direction of
the Holy Spirit, Rom. 7:4-6; 8:2-17; Gal.
2 : 19, 20 ; 5:25; Eph. 4 : 22-24, 3° ; Phi'. 3 • 3 5
Col. 3 : 1-17.

The whole testimony, therefore, concerning
the work of the Holy Spirit forbids one who
would become a child of God, to expect to
change his own heart, and shuts him up to
repentance toward God and faith toward the
Lord Jesus Christ ; and it is equally positive in
declaring that every one who has received Christ,
has been born of God, John 1:12, 13.

8. HOW ONE MAY KNOW PIE IS SAVED.

God calls upon the believer to know that he



ONE MAY KNO IV HE IS SA FED. 65

has passed from death unto life, John 5 : 24 ;

1 John 5:13.

The source of this knowledge is twofold ;
from the fruit of the Spirit in himself, and from
the testimony of God.

(1.) BY THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT.

The fruit of the Spirit in the life and experi-
ence of the believer, proceeding as it must from
the Spirit's presentation and revelation of Christ,
John 14 : 16-27 ; 16 : 13-15 ; Rom. 5:5; 8:15;

2 Cor. 3 : 18 ; is not to be sought by looking away
from Christ, to search one's own heart ; and yet
he who is consciously occupied with Christ is
conscious also of spiritual experiences, such as
righteousness, Rom. 14:17; 1 John 2:29;
3:5-10; love, joy, peace, and kindred graces,
Gal. 5 :22, 23 ; Rom. 15:13; obedience to his
commands, John 14 : 15 ; 1 Pet. 1 : 2, 22 ; 1 John

2 ' 3~S ; 3 : 18-24 ; love for the brethren, 1 John

3 : 14, 19-23 ; 5:1,2; the preciousness of Christ

1 Pet. 2:6, 7; the seven-fold products of faith,

2 Pet. 1 : 5-1 1 ; and the manifold characteristics
of the new man, Eph. 5 1-2 1 ; Col. 2:6, 7;

3:i-i7.

9



66 GOSPEL TRUTH.

Such an experience of Christ, which can be
wrought only by the Holy Spirit in one who
walks in him, assures the heart of the believer
before God ; and the more fully he enters into
this experience, the more conscious will he be of
his filial relation to God.

(2.) FROM THE TESTIMONY OF GOD.

God would not have the believer rely solely,
or even mainly, upon experience as the source
of assurance. Many children of God are either
in legal bondage, or distressed with doubts, be-
cause too much occupied with their " evidences,"
instead of looking at Christ, 2 Cor. 3:18.

Because of the fluctuations of emotion and
experience, and because the heart is deceitful
above all things, and incurably wicked, in
searching only himself, one may often be de-
ceived, and either be puffed up with false satis-
faction in himself, or brought into darkness and
uncertainty, Jer. 17:9; Rom. 7:11. On the
other hand, Christ is the truth as well as the way
and the life, John 14:6; 1 John 5:19, 20. And
it is not the Spirit's work in us, but Christ's work



FROM THE TESTIMONY OF GOD. 67

for us, which is the only ground of the believer's
acceptance with God, and so must be the great
source of his personal assurance of salvation.

The very Scriptures which bring one the tes-
timony to his own sin and the work of Christ,
also declare that he who believes is saved, Luke
7 : 48, 50 ; 1 Cor. 1 : 1 8 ; 2 Cor. 2:15; Eph. 2:5,
8 ; Tit. 3 : 5 ; 2 Tim. 1 : 9.

He who believes that Christ died for his sins,
1 Pet. 3:18, has the same word for it that he
is passed from death unto life, John 3 : 16, 36;
5:24.

He who believes the record that God has given
him His Son, has the same record upon which to
believe that Christ and eternal life are his, 1 John

5:9-13.

He who believes in Christ as having wrought

complete redemption through His blood, has the

testimony of God that this redemption is his,

even the forgiveness of sins, and that he is not

his own because bought with a price, Eph, 1 :6,

7 ; Col. 1 : 13, 14; 1 Pet. 1 : 18, 19 ; 1 Cor. 6 : 19,

20; Tit. 2 : 14.

He who believes that the sacrifice is perfect,



68 GOSPEL TRUTH,

has the word of God that Christ has made his
peace, that he is now brought nigh to God, and
that he is completely justified, Eph. 2:13-22;
Col. 1 : 20-22 ; Rom. 5 : 1 ; 1 Cor. 6:11; 2 Cor.
5:21; and possessing the remission of sins, has
boldness, by the blood of Jesus, to draw near to
God in the full assurance of faith, Hebrews
10: 12-22.

But the word of God certifies the believer of
his salvation by more than its testimony to the
completeness of the work of Christ for us. It
also bears definite testimony that all who believe
on him have been born of God. As, in human
birth, both the time and the parentage are known
upon testimony and not by consciousness, nor
memory, nor even by family traits and affections ;
so, even when one can fix upon no definite time
when he was born, and can remember no marked
experience which he would call regeneration, can
the believer upon God's testimony be perfectly
sure of spiritual birth, John 1 : 12, 13 ; 3 : 16, 36 ;
5 : 24 ; 1 Cor. 2 : 9-14 ; 1 Pet. 1 : 23.

Moreover, it is the will of God that the be-
liever should know that he has eternal life, 1 John



WHA T BELIE VERS ARE. 69

5 19-13 ; and the heart of the Father, not will-
ing that his child should walk in darkness, John
8:12; 12 146, longs to have him possess the joy
and strength which the assurance of salvation
would give.

9. WHAT BELIEVERS ARE AND HAVE, THE LIFE
TO WHICH THEY ARE CALLED, AND THE HOPE
SET BEFORE THEM.

Wonderful as the testimony already consid-
ered is, the love of Christ passes knowledge, and
an endless learning will be necessary in order to
know all that the believer is and has in Christ.
And while secret things belong unto the Lord
our God, Deut. 29 : 29, the things that are re-
vealed belong to us, and we are called to appre-
hend that for which we have been apprehended
in Christ Jesus, Phil. 3 : 8-14.

(i.) WHAT BELIEVERS ARE.
We are children of God through faith in
Jesus Christ, Gal. 3:26; 1 John 3:1, 2. We
are quickened with Christ, and in him are risen
and seated in heavenly places, Eph. 2 : 4-9. Our
citizenship is in heaven, Eph. 2:19, 20; Phil.



70 GOSPEL TRUTH.

3 : 20, Greek; Heb. u : 13-16; and we are the
family of God, Ephes. 2 : 19 ; 3 : 14, 15 ; Heb.
12:23, the brethren of the Lord Jesus Christ,
Heb. 2 : 10-12, 17, sons of God and joint-heirs
with Christ, Gal. 4 : 1-7 ; Rom. 8:14-17. As
the Father has loved the Son, so he loves us,
John 15:9; 17:23-26. We are a chosen gen-
eration, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's
purchased people, 1 Pet. 2 :g t 10, the espoused
Bride of Christ, 2 Cor. 11:2; Ephes. 5 : 25-27;
Rev. 19:7-9, and members in particular of his
body, 1 Cor. 12:12, 13; Eph. 1:22, 23; 4 : 15,
I( 5; S : 30 ; Col. 1 : 18, 24; 2 : 19.

Even as Christ is, so are we in this world,
1 John 4: 17. He is. the Lamb of God, John
1 : 36 ; we are the sheep of his pasture, the fol-
lowers of the Lamb, Psalm 23; 79:13; John
10 :4, 27, 28; Rev. 14:4.

He is the First-born of every creature, from
among many brethren, and from the dead, Col.
1 : 15, 18 ; Rom. 8 : 29 ; we are the church of the
first-born, Heb. 12:23. (In the Greek, "first-
born " is in the plural.)

He is the Beloved Son, Matt. 3:17; 17:5;



1VIIA 2" BEL IE VERS ARE. 7 1

Eph. 1:6; we in him are the beloved of God,
his children, Rom. 1:7; Col. 3:12; 1 John

3M.

He is the Holy One of God, Psa. 16: 10; in

him we are holy, Col. 3:12; Heb. 3 : 1.

He is the foundation-stone, Isa. 28 : 16 ; 1 Cor.
3 : 11-; we are living stones built upon him, and
of whom he is the crown and topstone, Eph.
2 : 20 ; 1 Pet. 2 : 4-7.

He is the vine, we are the branches, John

IS-

He is the Word of God, John 1:1, 2, 14;

Rev. 19:13; we are words of God, Acts 6:7;
12 : 24; 2 Cor. 3 :2, 3.

He is the King of kings, John 18 : 37 ; 1 Tim.
6:13-16; Rev, 17:14; 19:16, and the great
High-priest, Heb. 4:14; 8:1; we are kings
and priests unto God, 1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6;
not only witnessing a good confession, but also
interceding for the world, and bringing Christ
to those who are ruined.

He is the light of the world, John 8:12; we
in him are light and the children of light, Matt.
5:14; Eph. 5 : 8 ; 1 Thess. 5 : 4-8.



72 GOSPEL TRUTH.

He was the Servant of God, Matt. 20 : 26-28 ;
John 13:4-10; Phil. 2:7; we are servants of
God, Rom. 6.22 ; Jas. 1 : 1.

He was sent of the Father; we are sent of
Christ, John 17:18; 20:21.

(2.) WHAT BELIEVERS HAVE.

In Christ Jesus, as before shown, we have
eternal life, acceptance in the Beloved, redemp-
tion through his blood, and the forgiveness of
sins according to the riches of the grace of God ;
and so of him Christ is made unto us wisdom,
even righteousness, sanctification, and resurrec-
tion.* Though " all things " are thus now the
possession of the believer, grace and peace are
multiplied to us in the measure of our experi-
mental knowledge of what we have, 1 Cor.
3 : 21-23 ; 2 Pet. 1 : 1-4 ; Phil. 3 : 8-10. In Christ
we have the Father's care, Matt. 6 : 25-34 ; Luke

* The questions of the Greek philosophy, unanswerable by
human wisdom — How shall a man be just with God, pure in
heart, and delivered from the ruin which sin has wrought in
the body itself? — are all answered in Christ. The redemption
spoken of in I Cor. I : 30 is therefore, from the argument of
the passage, resurrection, the redemption of the body, Rom.
8 : 23 ; Eph. 1 : 14.

enly food, 1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 5 : 11-14, cf John
16 : 12, 25 ; Exod. 12 : 8-1 1, 14, cf 1 Cor. 5 : 7,

6 : 30-35 ; Exod. 16 : 12-22 ; Deut. 8 : 1-9 ; Psa.
81 : 13, 16 ; 119: 103 ; Ezek. 3 : 3, cf Rev. 10 :g,
10, and Numb. 21 : 4-6 ; Job. 23 : 12 ; Jer. 15 : 16,
the supply of every earthly need, Psa. 84 : 1 1 ;
103:1-5; Matt. 6:32, 33; Phil. 4:19; the
Shepherd's watchfulness, Psa. 23 ; John 10: 1-29,
wisdom, Prov. 2 : 1-11 ; Jas. 1 : 5 ; 2 Tim. 1 : 7,
guidance, Psa. 32 : 8 ; Prov. 3:5,6; John 16:13;
Rom. 8 : 14, power, Acts 1:8; Ephes. 3 : 16;
6:10; Col. 1 : 1 1 ; 2 Tim. 1 : 7, and victory over
the world, Rom. 8:37; 1 John 5 : 4, 5.

Thus it is ours experimentally to search out
the unsearchable riches of Christ, Eph. 3:8; to
know the love of Christ, which passes knowl-
edge, Eph. 3 : 19; in our hearts to understand
and be kept by the peace of God, which passeth
all understanding, John 14:27; Phil. 4:7; to
speak from experience the joy that is unspeaka-
ble and full of glory, John 15 19-11 ; 1 Pet. 1:8;

(3.) THE BELIEVER'S LIFE.

In view of what we are and have and hope
For in Christ, what manner of persons ought we
to be in all holiness of life and godliness, 2 Pet.

3:u.

We are bidden to consider Jesus, Heb. 3:1;
to walk in him, Col. 2:6, 7, and in his steps,
1 Pet. 2 : 21-25 ; 1 John 2:6; to walk worthy of
the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every
good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
God, Col. 1 : 10; and to walk worthy of the call-
ing wherewith we are called, Eph. 4: 1-3.

Entering into the manhood that is after God's
own heart, (see page 11,) it is his will that we
should appropriate the family personal pronouns,
(see page 41 and the epistles themselves,) and
be persuaded by the frequent " wherefore " and
" therefore " which leads from the teaching to
the arguments and exhortations by which the
Holy Spirit beseeches us in Christ, Rom. 6:12,
13; 7:4; 8:1, 12; 13:11-14; 14:12, 13, 18,

God is glorified in our lives according as we
bear much fruit, John 15:8, 16. See fruit of the
Spirit, page 65.

Thus we are called to be the obedient children
of God, John 14:15; 15:14; Rom. 6:16-18;
2 Cor. 10:5; 1 Pet. 1 : 13, 14, entirely consecra-
ted to him and to his service, Rom. 12: 1, 2;

the precious blood of Christ, 1 Cor. 6:19, 20;
7: 23 ; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19, and indwelt by his Spirit,
Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Cor. 6 : 16.

We are called to live by his word, Psalm
119:105; Matt. 4:4, studying it, Psa. 1:2;
119:24, 97-100; 2 Tim. 3:14-17; Col. 3:16,
and teaching it, Deut. 6:6-9; Matt. 13:52;
2 Tim. 4: 1, 2, ourselves taught and led by the
Holy Spirit, John 16:13; Rom. 8:14; 1 Cor.
2 : 1-4.

We are called to be separate from the world,
John 17:15, 16; 2 Tim. 2:3,4, from its aims,
Matt. 6 : 32, 33, from its eagerness after pleasure,

principles and maxims, Col. 2 : 8, and its associa-

the salvation of those under its sway, Luke
15:1-24; 1 Cor. 5:9, 10; 9:18, 22; Romans
9:1-3; 10: 1 ; Jude 22, 23.

We are called to love those who are Christ's,
John 13 ; 34, 35 ; 15 : 12-14, confessing him by
being united to those that are his, Rom. 12:3-
16 ; 14: 7 ; 15 : 1-7; 1 Cor. 11 :24 ; Eph. 4:2-
16, and not forsaking the assembling of our-
selves together as the manner of some is, Psa.
84 : 1-4, 10 ; Heb. 10 : 25 ; Jude 4, 8, 19.

We are called to follow Christ both as Master
and Leader, Matt. 11 : 29 ; Mark 2:14; Heb.

Acts 1:8; 4 : 20 ; 2 Cor. 5:11, 13; laboring for

souls, 1 Cor. 9:16, 19, 22, watching our influ-
ence, Rom. 14: 15 ; 1 Cor. 8:13, and walking
circumspectly toward them that are without,
Eph. 5:15; Col. 4 : 5 ; 1 Thess. 4:12.

We are to be pure in heart, 2 Tim. 2 : 19-22 ;
Phil. 4 : 8, 9 ; 1 Pet. 2:11, active, 2 Cor. 9 : 6-8 ;
Eph. 2:10; Titus 2 : 14, humble, Phil. 2 : 3, for-
bearing, Eph. 4:2; Phil. 2 : 14 ; Col. 3:12, 13 ;
1 Thess. 5:15, loving, 1 Cor. 13 ; 1 Thess. 3:12;

1 John 4 : 16, prayerful, Rom. 12 : 12 ; Eph. 6: 18 ;

Eph. 4:15; Phil. 3 : 12-14; 2 Thess. 1 : 3 ; 1 Pet,

(4.) THE BELIEVERS HOPE.

Holy and blessed as such a life is, precious
and wonderful as the relations and possessions

of the believer are, all is but the earnest of that
which is to come.

Though we have eternal life now, we also wait
for its fulness, John 17:3; cf.i John 3:2; Titus
1:2; 3 : 4-7.

Possessing the salvation of our souls, we are
heirs of the salvation yet to be revealed, 1 Pet.
1:5.

In the midst of suffering and service now,
there is awaiting us both rest, 2 Thess. 1:7;
Heb. 4 : 9, and reward, Dan. 12^3; Matt. 5:19;
6 : 19, 20 ; 10 : 32, 40-42 ; 16 : 27 ; John 12 : 26 ;
r Cor. 3:8-14; 4:5; 15:41; 2 Cor. 5:9, 10;
Rev. 14: 13, and still- more glorious service, Rev.
7;iS; 22:3.

To depart and be with Christ is far better
than our present joy, Phil. 1 : 21-24, but our hope
is resurrection, Acts 2:26; 23:6; 24:14, 15;
Rom. 8:23-25; 1 Cor. 15:23, 50-54; 2 Cor.
5 : 1-8 ; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; 1 Pet. 1 : 3.

The Lord Jesus is himself our hope, Eph.
4:4; 1 Tim. 1:1, and we shall be like him
when we see him, Rom. 8:11, 29,30; Phil.
3 :20, 21 ; 1 John 3:1-3.



THE BELIEVER'S HOPE, 79

Then shall be the manifestation of our son-
ship, Rom. 8:19; 2 Cor. 5 : 9-1 1 ; Col. 3 : 4, and
we shall be presented blameless and faultless un-
to himself and before the Father, Eph. 5 125-27 ;
1 Thess. 5 :23 ; Jude 24.

The marriage of the Lamb will come, and
"all glorious," her clothing of wrought gold, Ps.
45 : 13-15, his Bride shall sit down with him at
the feast, Matt. 22 : 1-14 ; 25 : 1-13 ; 26 : 29, cf.
1 Cor. 11:26; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:25-27;
Rev. 19 :7~9.

There is thus for us, kept by the power of
God, an inheritance that is incorruptible, 1 Pet
1:4; Eph. 2 :7, a fadeless crown, 2 Tim. 4:8 ;

1 Pet. 5 :4, a seat upon the throne with Christ,

2 Tim. 2:12; 2 Pet. 1 : 1 1 ; Rev. 3:21; 20 : 4.
and an endless fellowship with, him in glory,
John 17:22-24; Rom. 5:2; 8:16-18; 1 Cor.
1 5 : 43 ; 2 Cor. 4:17; Col. 3:4; 1 Thess. 2:12;
2 Thess. 1 : 10 ; 2 : 14 ; Heb. 2 : 10 ; 1 Pet. 1 : 7, 8 ;
5:1; 2 Pet. 1 : 3.

Utterly beyond our present conception as all
this is, il is revealed and is therefore no uncertain-
ty, 1 Cor. 2 :g, 10, being based upon the immu-



8o GOSPEL TRUTH.

table counsel and inviolable oath of God, Heb.
6:13-18; Eph. 1:3-14. For every one who
has fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
before us in the Gospel, it is " sure and steadfast,
an anchor to the soul, entering into that within
the veil," whither the Forerunner, even Jesus
our High Priest, has for us entered. Heb.
6 : 1 8-20.

FINALLY.

May the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of glory, give unto all who have believed
a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowl-
edge of him, the eyes of our hearts being en-
lightened that we may know what is the hope
of his calling, and what the riches of the glory
of his inheritance in the saints, Eph. 1 : 15-18.
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding
abundantly above all that we ask or think, ac-
cording to the power that vvorketh in us, unto
him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus
throughout all ages, world without end. Amen
Eph. 3 : 14-21.
