\section{Project to make}
This project will design and implement a plagiarism algorithm for checking documents against \emph{Wikipedia} pages. The program will be able to handle large documents and will achieve fast processing through massively parallel computation and the \emph{MapReduce} programming model. For demonstrating the algorithm, \emph{Docker} images will be used to emulate nodes in a larger data center.


\section{Timeline}
The project is divided into 3 working weeks of the semester where subgoals are set for each week. We do not expect to implement our stretch goals unless time permits it.

\paragraph{Week 10}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reading material: \cite{leskovec2014mining} chapter 6: \emph{Frequent Itemsets} and \cite{huang2008similarity}
    \item Simple model: Implement working example of a plagiarism algorithm using sample data on small documents
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Week 11 and 12}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extended model: Extend the simple model to include phrases from the \emph{Wikipedia} database
    \item Preliminary report
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Stretch goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parallel model: Implement \emph{MapReduce} on the extended model to allow for massively parallel computation of large documents
\end{itemize}
